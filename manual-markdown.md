# Workflows and Actions

In the earlier article [Understanding Workload Calculation](#), we explored the theme park entry ticket metaphor to illustrate that the activity type/cost table reflects the cost of entry, but you can still add additional workload by accessing different rides inside of the park.

This is especially true for workflows; each workflow can have a very low or even zero entry cost, but as you add dynamic expressions to it, the number and complexity of server requests can go up accordingly.

In this article, we'll continue looking at how different workflows â€“ and the operations that you add to a workflow â€“ contribute to the net total.

## Workflow Volume

Before we dive in, we'll repeat a point from earlier: each workflow in isolation does not usually incur a substantial workload cost. Of course, it still makes sense to optimize each and every workflow to be as efficient as it can be without compromising on UX or features, but there are also deadlines and developer resources to think about.

The way to prioritize is to look at workflows that have two similarities in common:
- They contain operations that typically consume a relatively high amount of workload, such as:
  - Database searches
  - Changing/copying/deleting a list of things
  - Scheduling bulk operations (API workflows on a list or recursive workflows)
- They are repeated frequently, such as:
  - Many times per user
  - Many times as a result of user growth

What we can learn from this is that a "heavy" operation that runs infrequently is not necessarily a big consumer of workload. Likewise, a frequent operation that is very lightweight is not necessarily worth optimizing. As you plan your workloads, try to identify those that spend a high amount over time. These are the ones that you want to try to optimize.

## The Total Calculation of an Action

Like we've done a few times in this article series, we'll have a look at how running an action is akin to the "entry ticket" metaphor.

In the example above, we want a list of Products to have a price that's an average of another list of products. Let's look at what we're doing:

1. First, we're starting the [Make changes to a list of things](#) action.
   - The total cost of the operation depends on the volume of the list and the number of changes being made.
2. Then, we perform a [Do a search for](#) to find the list of Products we want to make changes to.
3. Then, to make the requested change, we use another [Do a search for](#) and add the average operator to calculate the final price.

As we've seen in some of the earlier examples, it's important to be aware of the total work we're asking the server to do. We are not just running the Make changes to a list action, but also performing two database queries (Do a search for).

There are not necessarily any more efficient ways to do this: Make changes to a list of things is still more WU-friendly than Schedule API workflow on a list and recursive workflows. Make changes to a list of things works well for smaller lists (up to a few hundred things), but may time out if the list is too long.

The purpose is not to caution against the use of this action or its searches, but to further illustrate that WU consumption does not only depend on the specific action, but on other factors, as we listed above.

## Number of Actions

The number of server-side actions in a workflow has an impact on WU. With that in mind, when you develop your app and plan for WU consumption, it makes sense to think of each action in isolation rather than each workflow. A workflow in itself doesn't incur any cost; it's just the combination of a trigger and a collection of actions â€“ a folder, if you will.

There are a few things you can do to reduce the number of actions running in a workflow:
- Consider each action and see if it's needed. Can one or more actions be combined into one?
- Do all actions have to be executed every time the workflow runs, or could you stop one or more of them from running by using the [Terminate this workflow](#) action?

## Working with Lists of Things

Some actions work with a list of database things, as opposed to just one thing. Although these actions can be very useful, it's worth noting that processing a list of things demands more from the server compared to handling a single item, resulting in a greater WU cost. Actions include:
- [Make changes to a list of things](#)
- [Delete a list of things](#)
- [Copy a list of things](#)

Using these actions is still less costly than using Schedule API workflow on a list or a recursive workflow. As such, it's important to note that we're not cautioning against their use â€“ but merely pointing out that working with lists gives the server more work to do than working with a single item. Knowing that, you can make informed design and development decisions.

## Do When Condition Is True and Conditions

Do when condition is true works by checking a condition to see if it's true, and executing a workflow if it is. Do when condition is true is based on dynamic expressions, that can happen client-side or server-side, depending on what the condition is checking. Let's quickly look at a few examples.

### Checking Something in the Database (Server-side)

The database is stored and maintained securely on Bubble's servers. As such, any condition that requires communication with the database (whether it's creating, reading, updating, or deleting something) will incur a slight WU cost.

In this example, we are running a workflow if the number of users in your app exceeds 100. Note that Every time is checked, which means that every time a new user is added to your app, the condition will be re-checked, and the workflow will run.

It should be noted that this communication with the server can happen more often than you think:
- As the condition is first checked, Bubble performs a database query.
- As your database is updated (by that user or anyone else), Bubble's server may send the updated information to the user's device, again incurring a small WU cost.

Knowing this, we can again ask a few questions to optimize:
- Is the workflow needed at all?
- Does Run this - every time need to be selected, or can I reduce its frequency by instead selecting Just once?
- Is there some way we can trigger it by something other than a server-side condition? Such as a client-side condition or user action?
- The condition will usually be checked on page load. In other words, it will be checked every time a user loads a page. Can we avoid this somehow?

There are two lessons you should take away from this. The first is that the condition itself might incur a workload cost. The second is that the actions inside of that workflow may execute more often than you intended if you are not careful when setting up the Do when condition is true conditional expression.

### Checking If an Element Is Visible (Client-side)

Let's have a look at another example. In this one, we are checking if a group element is visible in order to trigger the workflow:

In this example, we are checking something on the user's device: whether a group is visible. This doesn't need Bubble's server to get involved, and does not incur a WU cost. However, it's less secure.

Bubble can verify if a condition holds true directly on the user's device, meaning the check is done client-side and doesn't involve Workload Units (WU). This kind of condition is executed swiftly as it doesn't require server communication, but it's less secure.

Employ client-side conditions for workflows where security isn't a major concern.

## The Order in a Conditional Expression

The order in which you place multiple conditions in a dynamic expression can make a difference in your WU consumption (as well as the speed at which Bubble will complete checking the condition). Before we dive into the example, let's summarize the logic with two simple rules:
- Bubble reads conditions from left to right.
- If any step connected with the and operator in the conditional expression returns a "no," Bubble will not check the rest of the conditions.

In other words, Bubble doesn't do more work than it has to when checking conditions. If a condition has two steps (connected with the and operator, as opposed to the or operator), and the first condition returns a "no," the second step will be disregarded. You can use this to your advantage. Let's combine the two conditions from our earlier example to see how this can work in practice.

In this example, the conditional expression has two steps: the first one is performed client-side, and the second one server-side.

In the example above, the condition has two steps, combined with the and operator:
- Is the element called Group example visible? and
- Is the number of users in the database more than 100?

If the first condition returns a "no," Bubble will not check the second, meaning that in that case, the condition has not incurred any WU cost. If you used the or operator, Bubble would have to check both of them, since any of them being true would return a "yes."
The example above would also be more secure than only using a client-side condition. If a user was able to somehow manipulate the first step to return a "yes" you didn't intend, the second server-side condition still cannot be tampered with and will return the correct response.

## Summary

Let's go over the points we've covered in this article:

- Workflows start with low impact but can increase in workload with added expressions and server-side actions.
- Prioritize workflows that are both high in workload and frequently executed.
- Consider overall workload, including associated database queries, not just the action itself.
- Merge actions when possible and use "Terminate this workflow" to stop unnecessary operations.
- Operations on lists are more demanding than single items. Faster and don't add to workload but offer less security.
- Bubble stops evaluating "and" conditions after a "no," which can reduce workload.
- Optimize workflows for workload without compromising security or user experience.

# Wiping change history


> Erasing the change history is irreversible and permanently deletes the database backups. Exercise caution when using this feature. Unless you fully understand the consequences and have a clear reason to use it, we advise you to not go through with it.

Bubble allows you to clear your database change history. This article will delve into the implications of this action and weigh its advantages and drawbacks.

## What does it mean to wipe the change history?

The databases (Development and Live) in your app are both continually backed up for every change that you make (often called real-time backup). This allows you to revert the database to any specific moment in the past, right down to the exact second. The length in time you can go back depends on the plan you are on.

The change history represents the records from these backups. By erasing this history, you forfeit the option to restore your database to any previous state. Once wiped, the real-time backups resume, setting your earliest possible restore point to the moment immediately after the wipe.

## Why would you want to wipe the change history?

In the majority of cases, there is no reason to erase these backups. They are there to make sure that in the case that you have any reason to revert your database to a previous state, you can do so quickly and without having to export or import any data.

With that said, there are a few scenarios where you may consider this option:

1. If you have data that you are completely comfortable erasing; for example, you may have test data in one or both of your databases that you want to erase forever.
2. Clearing the change history might slightly improve your database's performance due to reduced data. However, this potential minor speed boost must be balanced against the significant downside of losing your backup history. Though there might be a marginal benefit for extensive databases, we typically advise against erasing the change history solely for performance gains.
3. If your app is on the Enterprise plan, clearing database history can save storage space.
4. If you wish to permanently remove data, purging the database history is essential to ensure the data cannot be restored by rolling back to a previous state.

## How to wipe the database change history

To wipe the database change history, follow these steps:

1. Go to Data-App data in the Bubble editor.
2. Make sure you have the correct database (development/live) selected using the Switch to live database/Switch to development database in the upper right corner of the App data section.
3. Click Copy and restore database.
4. In the bottom part of the popup, follow the on-screen instructions and click Confirm.
5. Wiping the change history can take a few minutes, depending on the size of your database.

## FAQ: Wiping the database change history

**Will wiping change history affect both databases?**

Wiping your database change history will affect the database you are currently viewing in the App data section. See the instructions above for how to switch between the two.

**I accidentally wiped the change history â€“ is there any way to get it back?**

No, this is an irreversible operation. As such, we advise to exercise caution when using it. Make absolutely sure that you understand the ramifications, and that you have the correct database selected before performing the operation.

**Does wiping the change history disable the continuous backups?**

No, backups will continue from the moment a change is made in the database after the wipe. In other words, you will be able to revert back to the moment right after the wipe was made, but not earlier.

**Can I select what data to purge? I.e. only erase data of a specific data type?**

No, wiping the database change history will affect all data types in that database.

# Workflow API Privacy Rules


This section covers how API Workflows are affected by Privacy Rules.

## Introduction

Whenever you run any kind of workflow in your app, they will respect the privacy rules of any data type referenced in that workflow. The same applies to API workflows - the authentication of the client sending the request determines what kind of data they have access to.

Privacy Rules serve as a secure filter to stop unauthorized access to your app's database.

Itâ€™s important to note that privacy rules apply to what data they can see, but it doesnâ€™t affect the actions in your workflow. For example, a workflow may be affected by the "Find this in searches" privacy setting: in this scenario, an authenticated client would only be able to search for things that a privacy rule grants them access to.

## Privacy Rules and Workflow Actions

Privacy Rules affect your database. They can stop an API Workflow from accessing specific data based on who the client is, but it will not stop the API Workflow from running altogether.

Letâ€™s say that you have a "Make changes to a thing" action inside of that workflow. The action would complete regardless of Privacy Rules, but if you are searching for a thing to make changes to, Privacy Rules may stop you from finding the thing you want to change.

In other words, the action would technically complete, but if you donâ€™t find the record you want to make changes to it wonâ€™t make any difference.

## Data API Settings

The new Privacy Rule settings that are introduced when you activate the Data API in your appâ€™s settings (Create via API, Modify via API, and Delete via API) do not affect your API workflows.

In essence, by running an API workflow you have the freedom to change anything you want in the database, but the access to database records is still protected by privacy rules.

## Overriding Privacy Rules

In any API workflow, you can override Privacy Rules by checking the "Ignore privacy rules when running the workflow" box. This is useful in cases where you need to execute a workflow that needs to have access to data that the Current User does not have access to because of Privacy Rules.

Checking "Ignore Privacy Rules" lets you override the rules that affect the User that initiated the workflow in all the actions associated with this workflow.

# What Plugins Can Do

Plugins are elements, actions, events, or data sources that are not part of the Bubble core, but that you can use in your application. A plugin can add different things to your app, or a combination of these things.

## Background services

A plugin can add some code in the headers of your page and enable some background services in your app. Analytics services, for instance, are a very common background service that can be added to an app (Google Analytics, etc.).

## API data sources

Plugins can add API connections that can be used in the 'Get data from API' data source. Getting songs from iTunes, fetching animated GIFs from Giphy are examples of API Data sources.

## Authentication services

A plugin can add an authentication method to your app, through OAuth. OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for token-based authentication and authorization on the Internet. It allows an end user's account information to be used by third-party services, such as Facebook, without exposing the user's password. Practically, you'll be able to add a button to your app 'Login with Facebook', and users, instead of typing a password in your app, will authorize Facebook to grant access to your app.

## Elements

Many elements in Bubble are coming from plugins. Bubble's core elements only offer most common elements, as soon as you want to add something specific to your app, like a slideshow, an Excel-like table, etc. plugins will be the way to find these elements. Practically, these elements will function and behave similarly to Bubble's core elements in run-mode. Note that in edit mode, Community-built elements are not rendered, and will be displayed with a placeholder image.

## Actions

Plugins can add actions that connect with external services to your app. For instance, post something on the user's Facebook wall, send an email with a different provider, charge a credit card, etc. These actions behave in a similar manner as core Bubble actions.

## Private plugins

Plugins can be used to extend Bubble with your custom functionality as well. If you need some specific code to run, connect to a company's backend, you can write your own plugins and add them to your app.

# Workflow API Security

This section covers security related to the Workflow API.

## Introduction

The Workflow API allows external apps and systems to trigger specific workflows within your Bubble app. It provides a set of endpoints to initiate predefined sequences of actions or events in your app from outside sources. Naturally, opening up for external systems to activate workflows in your app can introduce potential vulnerabilities, so it's essential to learn how to use it correctly.

## Guiding Principles in Workflow API Security

### The Principle of Least Privilege

As discussed in various sections of our Security article series, the principle of least privilege remains important when working with the Workflow API. In this segment, we'll delve into methods and strategies to ensure adherence to this principle when setting up workflows that can be reached from outside of your own app.

In a bank, not every employee has the keys to the vault. A teller can access the cash drawer but doesn't have the authority to authorize large wire transfers. Conversely, the bank manager might have that authority but doesn't necessarily need access to every single safety deposit box.

### Authentication and Authorization

If you are reading this article series in order, you'll remember that we've talked extensively about authentication and authorization.

Authentication identifies who the client is, and authorization determines what they should have access to.

With the Data API, we explored how the what is basically the database; the data types, fields, and operations that a specific user can access. The Workflow API is essentially the same, except that instead of protecting data, we're protecting workflows.

We'll still use the same mindset when planning our security: every client that wants to trigger workflows in your app needs to go through the two steps of determining who they are and what they have access to.

## Authentication

When an API workflow is created, Bubble automatically generates a unique endpoint to trigger it, such as:

```https://my-bubble-application.bubbleapps.io/version-test/api/1.1/wf/my-workflow```


If the workflow required no authentication, knowing this URL would be enough for any actor (malicious or not) to trigger the workflow as many times as they want. Let's first talk about a few different reasons why you should be careful with that approach:

- Running an API workflow spends server resource, just like other workflows in your app.
- If an API is repeatedly triggered, it can increase your workload consumption.
- If left completely unchecked and continuously running, the Bubble has safeguards in place to ensure your app doesn't spend too much server resources: this can lead to your app slowing down or even stopping completely.
- Running API workflows can potentially make a lot of changes in your database â€“ by requiring authentication, you are adding one more potential safeguard on top of privacy rules and conditions in that workflow (we'll get back to this point later in the article).

While you are free to set up your API workflows as you see fit, we generally recommend that you always require authentication to run it.

### Access Levels

Just like with the Data API, the access level of an API workflow can be split into three categories:

1. No clients have access to any API workflows (the Workflow API is disabled or all API workflows are unexposed)
2. Some clients have access to selected API workflows (the Workflow API is enabled, but requires authentication)
3. Everyone has access (the Workflow API is enabled, and no API workflows require authentication)

#### No One Has Access

The first scenario is that no client, whatever their credentials, have access to any API workflows at all. There are two ways to do this:

##### Disabling the Workflow API

The first way is to disable the Workflow API altogether under Settings - API. This ensures that you don't have any Workflow API endpoints exposed at all, and nothing can be triggered from outside of your app. However, this also means that Bubble's backend editor will be disabled altogether, meaning that you cannot set up any internal API Workflows.

##### Disabling Individual Workflows

The second option is to keep the Workflow API enabled, but set every API Workflow that you create to be non-exposed. This means that the API workflow can be triggered internally in your app, but it will not have any endpoint that can be triggered from the outside. Using the Expose as a public API workflow setting allows you to cut an individual API workflow off from external apps and systems.

This way, only selected clients can run API workflows, and only selected workflows can be executed regardless of who the client is.

#### Some Clients Have Access to Selected API Workflows

The second option is to require authentication and open up for selected API Workflows to be triggered from outside of your own app.

##### Authentication

Authenticating clients to give them access to API workflows can be done in a few different ways. We go over this in detail in the article below:

[Article: The Bubble API: Authentication methods](https://example.com/authentication-methods)

Having set up the authentication, we can then proceed to set up which API workflows we want to expose.

API workflows are set to be exposed automatically when created â€“ keep in mind that in this step you are disabling those you don't want to expose, and not the other way around.

To disable API workflows that you don't want exposed, uncheck the Expose as a public API workflow setting. This removes the endpoint of that workflow entirely, making it impossible to trigger regardless of authentication.

Using the Expose as a public API workflow setting allows you to cut an individual API workflow off from external apps and systems.

This way, only selected clients can run API workflows, and only selected workflows can be executed regardless of who the client is.

#### Everyone Has Access

The final option is to open up API workflows to be triggered by anyone, without having to authenticate at all. Generally, we don't recommend this, as this opens up for potential misuse.

To open up API workflows to be triggered without any authentication, check the two boxes as illustrated above. Optionally, you can check the last box (Ignore privacy rules when running the workflow) to give the broadest possible access to your data as well.

## Authorization

With the Data API, authorization is generally linked to data â€“ what a client can see and make changes to. With the Workflow API, the picture becomes slightly more complex: since we are dealing with workflows, there are two more ways you can fine-tune your authorization for each individual client:

- Data (which can be protected with privacy rules)
- Conditions (which can set further restrictions on the workflow or individual action steps inside that workflow)

In the schematic illustration above, we can see the potential route a Workflow API request could take in terms of authorization.

First, Bubble determines who the client is (authentication), and then proceeds to check whether the client is allowed to run the workflow at all (Authorization 1). Then, the flow can potentially introduce two more authorization steps (illustrated as Authorization 2): a condition could stop the client from running the whole workflow or one or more of its actions, and privacy rules could limit the client's access to find data to make changes to.

### Data (Privacy Rules)

If you are unfamiliar with privacy rules, we highly recommend reading the articles below to get an understanding of how they work:

- [Article: Privacy rules](https://example.com/privacy-rules)
- [Article: Workflow API privacy rules](https://example.com/workflow-api-privacy-rules)

After having set up the authentication method you want to use, you then need to authorize those clients to access data within the action steps in that workflow. This understanding is important to take in as you plan your security, or you may get unexpected results.

Let's look at an example to illustrate:

Adding some information to a list of users

Let's imagine that we have a Bubble app with 100 users. As we start exploring how to work with an external system through the Bubble API, we realize we need to add some data to all of those users. Essentially, we want to make a change to all of them.

We decide to set up an API Workflow to do that job, and we open up for external access so that this can be triggered from the external app.

In the case of this API workflow we are in principle going through two rounds of authorization: first that the client is authorized to execute the workflow, and then which users they are able to search for.

Here's where the workflow versus data point becomes interesting. In this case, we are only authenticating once, but in principle we are going through two rounds of authorization:

1. Is the client allowed to run this workflow?
2. Is the client allowed to search for these users?

With this example, you can see why this could sometimes generate an unexpected result: while the client does have access to execute the workflow, they may not be able to actually search through all the users in the database.

Why is that? Because that data is protected by privacy rules, and the client does not match the needed credentials to download all of them. The unexpected result in this case might be that only a portion (or none) of the users were changed, as privacy rules stopped the client from finding them.

With the Data API, you can set specific privacy rules such as Modify via API, Create via API and so forth. Note that these settings apply to the Data API specifically; they do not affect an API workflow's ability to perform those operations.

### Overriding Privacy Rules

If you want to give the broadest possible access level to your data, an API workflow can be set up to ignore privacy rules altogether. Again, we generally caution against using this method as it gives free access to all data in your database regardless of the privacy rules set. Still, there are many scenarios where this is useful: just make sure you understand the implications of the setting.

### Conditions

If you are unfamiliar with conditional expressions, we highly recommend reading the article below to get an understanding of how they work:

- [Article: Conditions](https://example.com/conditions)
- [Article: Dynamic expressions](https://example.com/dynamic-expressions)

In this second step of authorization you would likely be more deliberate about its implementation: conditions.

Conditions can be added to the workflow itself or to any of its action steps and the result would be the same. Bubble will check the condition against the client trying to execute the workflow, adding another layer of authorization.

Keep in mind that privacy rules can also influence conditions. For instance, if a condition depends on a database search to validate, it may not yield the expected results if the results are constrained by privacy rules.

In the example above, we've further restricted one of the actions in the API workflow by adding a condition that checks whether the current user (the authenticated client running the API workflow) has a field called Admin set to yes. If this returns a no, the step will not run.

## Workflow API Security Checklist

- Keep the principle of least access in mind (link)
- Decide who has access (authentication)
  - First, decide who has access to the data API: No one (link), Selected clients and workflows (link), All clients (link)
  - Decide what they have access to (authorization)
    - Enable only the API workflows you want to expose (link)
    - Use privacy rules to control what data the workflow can find (link)
    - Use conditions to apply more fine-grained authorization (link)

### ACCOUNT & MARKETPLACE

# Account & Billing

This section covers how you can modify your account, subscribe to a plan, pay, etc.

## Account Management

# Account Management: Modifying Your Credentials

You can modify your email and password in the Account Page. For security reasons, you'll need to enter your existing password to modify either your email or change your password.

If you used Google Authentication and if you want to modify the email you're using to login, you should set up a password first. When signing up with Google, no password is created, but if you reset the password (in the Log in popup), you'll be able to define a password. This password will be the one you will need to enter when updating your credentials.

If you need to unauthorize your Google account, you need to do this in the Google App Dashboard. Revoking access to Google is not something that is done on the Bubble side.

# Deleting an Account

You can delete your account in the Account page. Note that when you delete your account, we delete your personal data (email, Bubble usage, etc.), but we do not delete the apps you have created and their database. If you need to delete them as well, you should delete the apps first.

# Adding API Connections

API calls are a way to get data from external services or trigger some actions on the service's end (send a message, charge a card, etc.). Usually (but not always), the first type of calls are going to be GET requests, while the second one is a POST. A call usually requires some authentication, so that the service identifies who is calling it (and may charge per call, etc.). You add such calls in the API Tab of the Plugin Editor. This is where you will define how the calls are authenticated, and which calls are used as data sources or as actions.

> **Note:** If an API call takes longer than 150 seconds to complete, Bubble will automatically retry this call. This is relevant if you're handling actions like sending emails where it may take more than 150 seconds to receive confirmation back from the service that the action has been completed. This may result in additional emails being sent if confirmation has not been processed.

You can see an example of the implementation of call of the iTunes API [here](#).

Implementing API connections can be different based on the API. While most APIs follow a few standards, if you hit some issues, we recommend reaching out to the API provider, and asking for help on the forum.

## Authentication

Designing the calls starts with the authentication method, which will sign the calls in Run-mode. Authentication can be done in several, standard, ways. Note that whenever you're building an API connection with some keys, you will need to enter some actual keys to test. These keys are only saved to help you work on your plugin. They will never get sent to users that use your plugins. Instead, they will have to enter their own API keys in the Plugins tab of the editor.

- **No authentication:** Nothing is added to call, or you are handling authentication with custom parameters and handlers. Note that we do not recommend handling authentication yourself, and instead use Bubble's built-in authentication system for a more secure connection.
- **Private key in URL:** A key is added in the URL, the key name can be modified in the editor.
- **Private key in header:** A key is added in the headers of all requests. It is very similar to the previous option. Very often, the header will look like Authorization: KEY , but you can customize the name Authorization if needed.
- **HTTP Basic Auth:** A username/password will be sent with each request, according to the HTTP Basic Auth protocol (see this).
- **Oauth2 Password Flow:** A password and a user name is used to get a token (see this for general information about this flow), that can expire and that is renewed automatically by your app. The token is returned when calling an endpoint that you'll need to fill in the Editor. The endpoint can be found in the API documentation. Search for 'token' or 'OAuth Bearer token' in the documentation.
- **Oauth2 Custom Token:** This flow is similar to the Password flow, but lets you define the call that returns the token yourself, in case it's not following the standard approach covered above. The token will be added to calls as a Bearer Token and will automatically be renewed when necessary. Note that to function, the token should be returned as an object with two keys (at least), access_token and expires_in .
- **Oauth2 User-Agent Flow:** This flow is the way most services connect when you use the API on behalf of the user (Facebook, Pinterest, Google, etc.). It will let you have access to users data when using the API (such as a profile name for Facebook). Setting such a service up will involve a few steps, as you will need to authenticate with your own account to be able to make authenticated calls in edit mode and initialize calls.

You usually start by setting an 'app' with the service you want to authenticate with. This service will then provide after this is set up a Client ID and a Secret that your app will use to communicate with the service.

You first need to fill the few pieces information and endpoints that are needed to get the token and the user ID. This endpoint will be used to generate the token, and retrieve the identity of a user with the service. All this information will be found in the API documentation. When you look at such documentation, we recommend looking for the section without SDK, but the web/HTTP section of it).

- **Scope:** each Oauth2 provider will require you to enter a scope, that defines the level of permissions you are asking for from your users. It can be readonly, write, send- messages...
- **Login Dialog redirect:** this the URL that will take the user to the service to authorize your app (and maybe login first to the service). It often will look like https://www.facebook.com/v2.8/dialog/oauth
- **Access token endpoint** is the URL that is used server side to get from a temporary code to an access token. For Facebook, is is https://graph.facebook.com/v2.8/oauth/access_token .
- **User profile endpoint** is the URL you use, once authenticated, to retrieve the current user's profile. This will include an ID, and usually an email (except if the service doesn't provide the email via the API). For Facebook, such URL is https://graph.facebook.com/v2.7/me (the 'me' is a common pattern). In some cases, if the ID isn't returned at the top level of the response to the previous URL, or has a different key than 'id', you can overwrite this in the two settings under the endpoint box.

Here is what authentication for Spotify looks like:

In the case of Oauth2 User-Agent Flow, you'll need to authenticate yourself with your own personal account to be able to initialize the calls. A button will prompt you to go through the flow, and will save the token once you have gone through the process. Here again, your personal identity and credentials with the service will not be shared with users that use your plugin.

- **JSON Web Token:** Some services use this more advanced protocol to handle scope and permissions. This is usually for enterprise-type services, like Box or Google Cloud. To authenticate with such a service, you will need to enter the scope, the email that is used to set up the service account and the endpoint that returns the token. You will also need to enter the private RSA key that the service is providing to set up the connection. Note that the key should be formatted as, including the '-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----' and '-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----'.
  
```
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
................................................................
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```


## Shared Headers

If you need to add some shared headers to all calls, including the authenticating ones, you can define them in the following section. Note that the value you will set here can be 'hidden' or 'secret'. Hidden settings will be hardcoded by you, as the plugin builder, and plugin users will not fill this key. Most of the time, this is used for technical headers, like a content-type, etc. The secret type will prompt your plugin users to enter a key in the Plugins Tab.

## Defining the Call Endpoint

Once you have properly entered authentication information, you can start setting up your calls. You start by defining the request method, copy the endpoint that should be hit, and define the different parameters that the user will have to fill. Note that if you enter a part of the URL between [ and ], the value in between will be a parameter.

Parameters can be of several types: public, hidden or secret.

- **Public parameters** will be modified by the user at the call level (that's for instance a term for query API call).
- **Hidden parameters** are for the plugin builder, and won't be exposed to the user that uses the plugin. For instance, it can be an encoding type, etc.
- **Secret parameters** are good for keys, etc. Users will enter these in the Plugins Tab of the editor.

Once a call is defined you need to initialize it to make it usable in Bubble. An API call can return five different types of data.

- **JSON:** This is the most typical case of a REST API, it returns an object with key and values. If you pick this type, you will be prompted to pick a data type of each key in a popup after initializing the call. When you initialize a call, Bubble makes the actual request, and analyze the returned data.
- **XML:** Some APIs returns their response as XML. Often, this can be converted into a JSON object. If you are dealing with such an API, you can use XML and get data as a JSON object, and go through the flow described above. Note that not all XML responses can be converted as JSON. If Bubble fails to do so, an error message will be displayed.
- **Image:** Some APIs return the raw image as the response. It can be a URL that you can use in an <img> tag, for instance. In such a case, the API call in Bubble will return an image that can be used in an Image element, or as a page background.
- **Text, Number:** If the API returns a string or a number (without structuring this as a JSON object), you should pick this option. Note that changing the types once an API is public can be non-backward compatible, so do this with caution and make sure to document this as a breaking change when you publish your plugin (see below).
- **Date Range, Number Range:** While these are Bubble data types, we do not support these data types for our API Connector. If you want to use the API Connector for date ranges or number ranges, a workaround is either to send dates/numbers as two separate fields or as a two-item list of dates/numbers and format them as ranges elsewhere in your app. If you want to use the API Connector to query range data from another Bubble app, we suggest using the App Connector instead.
