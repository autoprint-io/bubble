 Welcome to Bubble

The Bubble docs are designed both to get you quickly onboarded and to help you start building, and to serve as a reference through your learning journey and beyond. To learn more about how the docs are structured, you can read our [Introduction](https://manual.bubble.io/).
 How long does it take to learn Bubble?

Learning Bubble's essentials can take from a few days to a few weeks, depending on how much time you invest and how you approach your learning.

Embracing Bubble is best approached with a thirst for learning. Rather than diving in with immediate expectations, taking the time to grasp the foundational elements will be very beneficial in your learning journey. As you become proficient with the platform, you'll develop your own methods and habits for creating stable, secure apps quickly.

We encourage you to keep in mind that Bubble is a very open platform. What this means is that its flexible enough to be able to host almost any category of apps. The other side of that coin is that you are also free to make mistakes: Bubble gives you the tools for setting up enterprise-level professional apps, but it's up to you to use those tools in the right way.

Learning Bubble properly is an investment: if you have a strong foundation, you will be able to bring your app idea to life in a secure, stable and scalable way.

 What is Bubble?

What is Bubble?

Rather than specializing in one or two aspects of web development (like designing landing pages or building databases), Bubble’s full-stack visual programming interface does it all. You can customize your UX with a drag-and-drop editor, build out logic, manage databases, and more. Plus, you can integrate with anything via plugins and API. In fact, it has all the tools you need to build a site like Facebook or Airbnb.

Here are a few key features you’ll encounter as you dive in:

Visual programming editor

Bubble’s main interface — called the editor — allows you to build your app by pointing and clicking instead of writing code. It’s where you design the page, structure the database, and build workflows that respond to user actions. As you build, you’ll see the results on the screen, and you can preview your app with a single click.

You can dive deeper in the sections on [designing your app](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design) and [creating workflows and logic](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic).

Database management

Building and maintaining a database is a complex task, so Bubble automates every aspect of it. As soon as you create an app, its developer and live databases will be ready to use. We’ll perform continuous point-in-time backups with easy restoration, and industry-standard security and privacy management tools are built in.

You can set up and manage all of this in just a few clicks, even if you have no prior database experience. Read more in the [database section](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database).

User management and security

Bubble's built-in user management tools enable you to let users sign up for and log in to your app securely. All our user management functionality aligns with industry standards for security and privacy while giving you the flexibility you need to set up workflows and methods that suit your app.

You can read more in the [user account management section](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/user-accounts). If you work with a team of developers, you can also learn how to set up isolated working environments in the version control section.

Third-party integration

Most modern app development requires you to your app to third-party systems, from other apps to service providers like weather reports and generative AI models. Using one of our community-made plugins or Bubble's own [API connector](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-api-connector), [app connector](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/bubble-app-connector), or [SQL connector](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/sql-database-connector), you can set up connections to other systems quickly and securely.

Scalability

From the platform to our pricing plans, Bubble was designed to scale with your app as it grows The Bubble engine and database is hosted securely on Amazon AWS, the world's largest network of internet servers and services, and file assets are spread out across the Cloudflare Content Delivery Network. This combination gives you the power to scale quickly and confidently.

You can read more about Bubble’s tools for scaling in the [performance and scaling section](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/maintaining-an-application/performance-and-scaling).

We can’t wait to see what you build

Bubble exists to enable anyone from first-time entrepreneurs to enterprise-level companies to take an idea from concept to fully functional, scalable reality — faster and cheaper than you could with just code.

So head over to the [Building your first app](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/building-your-first-app) section, and let’s dive in.

Branch

- A branch is an independent iteration of your application that can be developed in isolation.
- You can see the creation of a branch as splitting your app into two copies, kind of like two cells dividing. The cells are genetically identical clones at first, but can keep evolving independently of each other.
- This is useful if you have different developers/teams that are working on specific features in your app: they can work completely independently without disturbing each other's work
- Branches are a part of the [version control](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossarversion-control) feature

Learn more

Article series: [Version control](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/maintaining-an-application/version-control)​

Bubble API

- The Bubble API is the umbrella term for Bubble's API features
   - The [Workflow API](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossarworkflow-api)​
      - Allows external apps and systems to execute workflows in your app
   - The [Data API](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossardata-api)​
      - Gives external apps and systems secure access to your database
- The Bubble API offers security in two different ways
   - **Authentication**
      - The process of determining *who* is trying to access the resource
   - **Privacy rules**
      - Conditions applied to data in your database that determines whether the authenticated client has access to search for, read, change or delete data of a specific type
- The Bubble API is for *inbound* API calls (calls made *to* your app from the outside) as opposed to outbound calls that are made with the [API connector plugin](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossarapp-connector-plugin))

Using the Bubble API is among Bubble's most advanced features, but it also offers vast possibilities for integration with other online platforms.

Cell

- Each individual row or column in a repeating group or table element is called a *cell*.
- Each cell's data source automatically represents the cell's index in the list of loaded data (for example, if you load a list of *users*, each cell will have one user as its data source)
- Each cell has an index number, starting with 1 and increasing sequentially

- It's used to compare two values, such as:
   - Checking whether to users have the same name
   - Checking whether the number 4 is bigger than the number 5
   - Checking whether the creator of a [database thing](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossarthing-database) is the current user
- A comparison will return either a *yes* or *no*
   - If you come from a traditional programming background, this would be the same as *true* or *false*

Learn more

Article: [Dynamic expressions](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/dynamic-expressions)​

Current user

- The current user is a [data source](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossardata-source) which returns the [database thing](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossarthing-database) of the currently logged-in [user](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossaruser)​
   - If no user is logged in, it will return a temporary user profile that you can still save data to
- Using the current user data source, you can return data such as *Current user's email* in a [dynamic expression](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossardynamic-expression)​

Learn more

- Article: [User accounts](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/user-accounts)​

Constraint / search constraint

- A search constraint narrows down the results of a database search by specifying certain conditions that the data must meet
- For example, you can search for all users called "Jane Doe" by setting up a constraint that specifies that the field called *name* should contain the text *Jane Doe*.
- You can add as many constraints as you want to a search
- Adding more constraints can lead to a faster search, since it helps Bubble rule out things quicker

Core reference: [Custom event properties](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/events/custom-events)​

Custom state

- A custom state is a way to store temporary variables on an element that can be accessed from anywhere on the same page and during the same session
- Custom states are reset when the page is refreshed, meaning they don't store data permanently
- They can hold any kind of data like text, numbers, dates or custom data types and can be read, changed and reset as needed using [actions](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossaraction)​
- Custom states can hold a default value

   - It can be created by you, or added by your app's users
- Every app has its own two databases;
   - Development
   - Live
- They two are completely independent, so that you can use one for testing and one for live users
- You can create [custom data types](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossardata-type) in your app to suit your own needs. For example, you might want to create data types like *projects, blog posts, tasks* or *blog posts*.
   - To each of these data types, you can add [*fields*](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossarfield-field-type) that contain data
- Bubble is designed to allow you to set up and configure your database with no prior knowledge, but the underlying technology is PostgreSQL

Article: [Server logs](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/maintaining-an-application/testing-and-debugging/using-server-logs)​

Operator

- An operator is part of a [dynamic expression](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossardynamic-expression)​
- Operators are used to manipulate or aggregate data from a [data source](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossardata-source). For example:
   - Turning a string of text into UPPERCASE
   - Counting the number of characters in a string of text
   - Calculating the the number of results of a search
- Operators can be chained together
- Bubble will show relevant operators as you build your expression; or example, the *:number of characters* operator will be visible when you are working with text, but not when you are working numbers

Option set

- An option set is a static collection of options that can contain multiple fields
- It behaves in much the same way as data types, but are not dynamic
   - This means they cannot be changed without re-deploying your app
   - It also means they cannot be updated by your users: only by a Bubble developer with access to the [Bubble editor](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossareditor-the-bubble-editor)​
- They become part of your app's source code
   - This means they load faster than the database, and remains cached on the user's device
   - It also means they should not contain any sensitive data, since they are downloaded in plaintext to every device that accesses ay page in your app
- Option sets are great for storing data that doesn't change frequently, such as a list of:
   - Colors
   - Countries/states
   - Menu options
   - Dropdown options

Privacy / privacy rules

- Privacy refers to the protection of user data and information, ensuring it's accessed and shared only by the right user(s)
- Privacy and security are closely intertwined, but are not the same thing: privacy is a policy, while security is what maintains that policy
- Bubble uses privacy rules to protect data in the database from ever leaving the server if the user is not authorized to access it
- Privacy rules also protect data accessed through the Bubble API
- Privacy rules are applied to each data type as a condition (i.e. "If this user is logged in, they can access the data)

SPA (Single-Page Application)

- A Single-Page Application (often abbreviated to SPA) is a way to set up your app's navigation as a single page, as opposed to navigating between pages
- This is done by hiding and showing elements on the page
   - This is predominantly done using the group element, and collapsing its width and height when hidden to make room for another group
   - This happens instantaneously, making the switch between groups unnoticeable for the user

   - For example, in "[my-bubble-app.com/page?navigation=user-profile](http://my-bubble-app.com/page?navigation=user-profile)", "navigation=user-profile" is the URL parameter
- URL parameters can be used to pass any kind of data, including custom [data types](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossardata-type) (by passing the [unique ID](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossarunique-id) of the thing you want to identify)
   - The upside of using URL parameters is that users can use the *back* button in their browser to return to the previous URL if needed, meaning that they can use the back button in a [single-page application](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossarspa-single-page-application)​
   - You set URL parameters using the go to page action, and the URL parameter is instantly applied without having to reload the page (if you are going to the same page the user is currently on).

How to use the Bubble Manual efficiently

The **Bubble user manual** is our long-form collection of articles that teaches you Bubble from start to finish. We've designed the manual so that you can read it from A-Z or pick the categories and specific articles that you need.

Instead of delving into each individual setting and property, we explore broader topics such as design, data and logic, and we even touch on subjects not directly tied to Bubble, aiming to foster an overall understanding of web applications at large.

If you are looking for more concise, technical documentation for each of Bubble's features, you may be interested in checking out the [core reference](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/using-the-core-reference) section of the docs. In [New? Start here section](https://manual.bubble.io/new-start-here) we also [list other resources](https://manual.bubble.io/new-start-herlearning-bubble) such as videos, user community and interactive tutorials.

How to read the user manual

The user manual is designed like a guidebook, allowing you to either read it from beginning to end or select specific sections based on what you want to learn more about. If you have just getting started with Bubble, we recommend you check out each section and get to know the how the manual is structured.

This way, if you don't want to read every section in full now, you can return to any subject for a thorough overview when you need it.

Manual sections

Getting started

This section focuses on the basics of Bubble and is meant for users who are new to the platform. Here we'll explore the basic stuff such as creating an app, navigating the editor and changing the general application settings.

If you have played around with Bubble for a little while and know about the basic stuff already, you can use the navigation menu on the left to find the categories that interest you the most.

Bubble lets you set up flexible, responsive design and save them in styles that can be applied every in seconds.

​[Elements](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements)

Elements are the things that you place on a page to display data and let your users interact with your app. Whether you want to create an elaborate presentation page with images and animations or a simple signup form, it's all done by combining different elements in a way that your users find useful and visually pleasing.

Bubble offers a lot of different elements serving different purposes and this article series covers them all.

Article series: [Elements](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements)​

​[Styling](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/styling)​

Each element that you add to your page has a default *styling* applied to it. In short, styling refers to what your elements look like, and this is done by changing styling settings such as:

- Background color, gradient or image
- Border
- Shadow
- Font
- Transitions

Bubble also features ways to save styling settings to help you maintain and update how your app looks efficiently.

Article series: [Styling](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/styling)​

​[Responsive design](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/responsive-design)​

Responsive design is a method that gives your users a great experience no matter what kind of device they are using to access your app. Bubble features a *responsive engine* that lets you control every aspect of your app's responsiveness in the same visual editor that you use to build your pages. It uses a grid-based layout to change the appearance of the page depending on the screen size and orientation of the device.

Article series: [Responsive design](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/responsive-design)​

​[The component library](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/the-component-library)​

The component library is a collection of pre-built User Interface (UI) components that can be dragged and dropped onto your page to help you build beautiful interfaces faster. These UI components are fully responsive and are made up of containers, visual elements, and form inputs that can be individually customized once added to your page. Each component is a fully independent unit, but can be connected to each other or other parts of your app by adding workflows and data.

Article: [The component library](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/the-component-library)​

​[Importing from Figma](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/importing-from-figma)​

Many users have a background from Figma. Bubble has a tool for importing your Figma design into Bubble, maintaining style attrbiutes such as colors, fonts, shadows, etc. This article covers how the import process works.

Article: [Importing from Figma](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/importing-from-figma)​

Data

Data forms the foundation of any application. Indeed, creating an app that doesn't handle data in some way is unusual. Be it data produced by your users, added by you, or imported from external applications or services, the capability to collect, secure, and present information essentially drives the existence of most apps.

![bubble-database-design.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FwDYfLkyFstxaevuuA6Kt%2Fbubble-database-design.png?alt=media&token=751edbd0-4a34-4b94-9ffb-9df0a9c1f560)

Bubble's database editor lets you create, assign fields to and connect data types with no database experience.

​[The database](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database)​

The database manages all the dynamic data that both you and your users have added. You can create, modify, view, and delete data as needed and run bulk operations to make major updates.

Data in the database is stored securely on Bubble's servers.

Article series: [The database](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database)​

​[Files](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/files)​

Bubble offers integrated tools within the editor and your app for handling file and image uploads and storage.

Article: [Files](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/files)​

​[Static data](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/static-data)​

Static data in Bubble is defined as data that requires your app to be re-deployed to update and cannot be changed by your application's users (unlike dynamic and temporary data).

This is useful for saving data that you need to re-use in your app, but that doesn't change very often, such as strings of text and options in a list.

Article series: [Static data](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/static-data)​

​[Temporary data](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/temporary-data)​

Sometimes you'll need to store some information temporarily in your application. They can be considered *variables* and are not in any permanent storage like the database, but live for as long as they are needed.

This is useful for holding some information while the user is still one the same page and for navigation.

Article series: [Temporary data](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/temporary-data)​

​[User accounts](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/user-accounts)​

Bubble has a built-in feature to handle user accounts. In other words, your users can create and log in to their account purely with built-in tools that are secure, efficient and easy to set up.

Article series: [User accounts](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/user-accounts)​

Logic

The *Logic* section covers how to make Bubble *do* stuff: by combining workflows and expressions, you can set Bubble up to perform tasks for your users ranging from very simple to highly complex.

![workflow-editor.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F4EKvQH9AZzJPPYUtVU2I%2Fworkflow-editor.png?alt=media&token=78b8e5bd-b46a-47e6-a217-02f13de4ae90)

Bubble's workflow editor lets you drag and drop actions that happen whenever an event takes place, such as a button click.

​

​[The frontend and the backend](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/the-frontend-and-backend)​

To understand Bubble, is useful to understand the difference between things happening on the page, and things happening on Bubble's server. This article takes a theoretical look at how the two are different – and how they work together constantly to make your app work.

Article: [The frontend and the backend](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/the-frontend-and-backend)​

​[Workflows](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/workflows)​

Workflows in Bubble are sequences of actions that automate your app's operations. They trigger in response to events such as a button click or page load, allowing you to create dynamic and interactive applications. In short, they are what makes your app *do* something.

Article series: [Workflows](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/workflows)​

​[Dynamic expressions](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/dynamic-expressions)​

Dynamic expressions are like "live" formulas that update in real-time based on user input, database updates and other changes in your app. They can fetch data, change and combine texts, calculate numbers and dates and a lot of other things.

Article: [Dynamic expressions](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/dynamic-expressions)​

​[Conditions](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/conditions)​

Conditions in Bubble are the rules you set to make your application react to different scenarios. They define the "if this, then that" logic in your app, controlling how elements behave, look or function based on different variables, like user inputs or data changes.

Article: [Conditions](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/conditions)​

​[Navigation](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/navigation)​

Navigation in Bubble is the way you manage the flow between different pages or parts of your app. It involves creating links, setting up redirects, or loading different groups or popups on a single page.

Article series: [Navigation](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/navigation)​

Maintenance

Every app requires some testing and maintenance, and Bubble has many different tools for staying on top of it, as well as advanced collaboration features for teams.

​[Collaborators](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/maintaining-an-application/collaboration)​

One of Bubble's big strengths is the ability to add up to 40 collaborators to your projects. Collaborators are registered Bubble users that you can give access to the editor in a specific app so that you can work on it together.

You can also set up independent iterations of your app (called *branches*) that allow your collaborators to concentrate on specific features and changes, maintaining their work separate from other ongoing projects. See [*Version control*](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-starteversion-control) below.

 What is Bubble?
 What is Bubble?

[](https://youtu.be/IwiZC4dcLUk)

Rather than specializing in one or two aspects of web development (like designing landing pages or building databases), Bubble’s full-stack visual programming interface does it all. You can customize your UX with a drag-and-drop editor, build out logic, manage databases, and more. Plus, you can integrate with anything via plugins and API. In fact, it has all the tools you need to build a site like Facebook or Airbnb.

Here are a few key features you’ll encounter as you dive in:

**Visual programming editor**

Bubble’s main interface — called the editor — allows you to build your app by pointing and clicking instead of writing code. It’s where you design the page, structure the database, and build workflows that respond to user actions. As you build, you’ll see the results on the screen, and you can preview your app with a single click.

You can dive deeper in the sections on [designing your app](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design) and [creating workflows and logic](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic).

**Database management**

Building and maintaining a database is a complex task, so Bubble automates every aspect of it. As soon as you create an app, its developer and live databases will be ready to use. We’ll perform continuous point-in-time backups with easy restoration, and industry-standard security and privacy management tools are built in.

You can set up and manage all of this in just a few clicks, even if you have no prior database experience. Read more in the [database section](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database).

**User management and security**

Bubble's built-in user management tools enable you to let users sign up for and log in to your app securely. All our user management functionality aligns with industry standards for security and privacy while giving you the flexibility you need to set up workflows and methods that suit your app.

You can read more in the [user account management section](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/user-accounts). If you work with a team of developers, you can also learn how to set up isolated working environments in the version control section.

**Third-party integration**

Most modern app development requires you to your app to third-party systems, from other apps to service providers like weather reports and generative AI models. Using one of our community-made plugins or Bubble's own [API connector](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-api-connector), [app connector](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/bubble-app-connector), or [SQL connector](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/sql-database-connector), you can set up connections to other systems quickly and securely.

**Scalability**

From the platform to our pricing plans, Bubble was designed to scale with your app as it grows The Bubble engine and database is hosted securely on Amazon AWS, the world's largest network of internet servers and services, and file assets are spread out across the Cloudflare Content Delivery Network. This combination gives you the power to scale quickly and confidently.

You can read more about Bubble’s tools for scaling in the [performance and scaling section](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/maintaining-an-application/performance-and-scaling).
 We can’t wait to see what you build

Bubble exists to enable anyone from first-time entrepreneurs to enterprise-level companies to take an idea from concept to fully functional, scalable reality — faster and cheaper than you could with just code.

So head over to the [Building your first app](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/building-your-first-app) section, and let’s dive in.

----
 Building your first app

Starting your journey in app development can feel like learning a new language, especially with the intricate jargon and technical terminologies used in traditional programming. Bubble uses intuitive and self-explanatory terminology like *things*, *workflows*, and *conditions*, to remove the barriers of complex coding languages, allowing you to focus on bringing your ideas to life.

In this article series we'll explore the strategy for building your first app, and cover the basic Bubble concepts to get you up to speed quickly.
 What does it mean to build an app?

If you are new to app development, it may not be entirely clear what exactly it entails to build an app. That's not strange at all – after all, in traditional programming, an app is built by a *team* of people where each member specializes in one key discipline such as design, coding and database management. Bubble, on the other hand, is built to make you able to do that all on your own.

That doesn't mean that you *can't* work with a team – you most certainly can – but it means that our tools are designed so that you don't have to. Bubble provides the flexibility and resources for both solo developers and teams to bring their app visions to life.

Most apps are about collecting information, and then manipulating and presenting it in a way that's solves problems for its users. While apps can seem extremely different on the outside, they are mostly all the same thing: a useful design on top of a database.

- A **social network** collects data about users (name, profile pic, age, interests, posts) and then loads that from the database to show it to other users. A *like* on Facebook or X may *feel* social, but it's all simply data that's presented in a social way.
- A **CRM** collects data about clients, vendors and contacts, and then lets its users pull that data up whenever needed. Maybe it also crunches some data into statistics.
- A **food ordering app** collects data about restaurants, menu items, drivers, customers and orders and uses that data to automate the ordering process.

You get the point – while these are all very different categories, they are in essence doing the same thing: at the bottom is a database that users fill up with data, and on top of that is a design that makes the data useful. Many apps simply take real-life things we were already doing, like talking about our interests and ordering food, and automates them.

So, to build an app, you need to:

- Set up your **database** to store information
- Design a **user interface** that intuitively directs users to add, modify, delete, view, and analyze data effectively
- Link your design to **workflows**, ensuring that the app responds to user interaction

Most applications are built in an incremental way: they are designed to solve a simple problem (like remembering a list of clients), and then its developer progressively new helpful features are added.
 Core terminology

As you embark on your app-building journey, you'll come across some specific terms that will become the building blocks of your Bubble experience. Knowing the terms and phrases that are frequently used will also help you communicate with other Bubble users in the [forum](https://forum.bubble.io/).

For a more complete list of Bubble terminonology, you can also check out our glossary.

Article: [Glossary](https://manual.bubble.io/the-glossary)​

Let's demystify these terms to ensure you have a smooth start. In each of the expandable boxes below, we'll explore one facet of app building and go over the terminology used in each one.

Design: how your app looks

We'll start by exploring **elements**. This is any visual item or component you'll place on your Bubble page. Think buttons, texts, inputs, and so on. It's what makes up your app's interface your app's interface.

Elements can have **styles** associated. This lets you set up design attributes (color, border, shadow, font, etc) in one place and apply it to multiple elements.

Bubble comes with a lot of built-in elements, but you can also add new types of elements with [plugins](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/building-your-first-applugins-enhancing-bubbles-capabilites).

- Page: [Bubble plugins](https://bubble.io/plugins)​

Workflows: making your app do stuff

As you design, you'll be introducing interactions. Here's where **Workflow** comes into play. Imagine you want something to happen when a button is clicked - that's a workflow. It's a sequence of automated steps or actions initiated by an **event**.

The event is the specific trigger for your workflow. A button being clicked, a dropdown being changed, or even a page loading can all be events that kickstart a workflow.

Each step in a workflow is known as an **action**. Actions can make changes in the database, navigate to another page, hide/show something on the page and a wide range of other things.

**Learn more:**

- Article series: [Workflows](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/workflows)​

Conditions: if this, then that

Often, you'll want actions to happen only under certain circumstances. Enter **conditions**. This is the "if this, then that" of Bubble. Conditions dictate when specific actions or visual changes should take place based on criteria you set. For example, clicking a button takes you to another page, but *only* if the current user is logged in.

Conditions can also be placed on elements to control their appearance. For example, a button is only visible if the current user is logged in.

Conditions are built using **dynamic expressions**. Dynamic expressions are like "live" formulas that update in real-time based on user input, database updates and other changes in your app.

**Learn more:**

- Article: [Dynamic expressions](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/dynamic-expressions)​
- Article: [Conditions](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/conditions)​

The database: managing data

As you populate your app with data, you'll be dealing with **Things**. A 'Thing' is just an individual piece of data in Bubble. Think of it as an entry or record in the database, such as a specific user.

Each Thing belongs to a **Data Type**, which is like its category or table. For instance, if you're building a blogging app, *Blog Post* could be a data type. If you're building a task management app, both *Task* and *Project* can be data types.

Within these data types, there are **Fields**, which are attributes or properties. Using the Blog Post example, *Title* and *Content* could be fields.

To protect your data, you use **privacy rules** to define who can access or modify what data. It's your one-stop control center for data protection.

- Article: [Protecting data with privacy rules](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/protecting-data-with-privacy-rules)​

Previewing: testing your app before users get access

Bubble gives you two distinct environments: Test and Live

**Test environment**: This is your sandbox, a safe space where you can experiment, iterate, and make changes without affecting your actual users. Any data you use or create here won't touch the live environment. It's an ideal place for debugging and trying new features.

**Live environment**: This is the real deal. The data here is what your actual users will interact with. Once you're satisfied with the changes in your test environment, you can **deploy** them to the live environment, ensuring that your users always experience a polished and tested version of your app.

Each environment has its own separate database. This distinction ensures that your test experiments won't accidentally overwrite or corrupt the real user data you've gathered.

If you need more advanced branching capabilities to work on features in isolation, you can also use our version control feature.

**Learn more:**

- Article series: [Version control](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/maintaining-an-application/version-control)​

Reusable elements: avoid repeating work

As you build, you might create a component that you want to use repeatedly. That's a **Reusable Element**. It could be a navigation bar, footer, or any component you don't want to rebuild from scratch every time.

**Learn more:**

- Article: [Reusable elements](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/reusable-elements)​

Plugins: enhancing Bubble's capabilities

Now, there will be instances when you want to enhance Bubble's capabilities. That's where **Plugins** come in. They're like add-ons, enhancing functionality or allowing integrations.

There is a collection of Bubble-built plugins, and a plugin store with thousands of user-created plugins.

- Article: [Plugins](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/using-plugins)​
- Page: [Bubble plugins](https://bubble.io/plugins)​

API: connecting your app to other apps

You'll likely come across the term **API**, an acronym for Application Programming Interface. Think of it as a language that allows your app to communicate and exchange information with other applications. This capability unlocks a treasure trove of possibilities: from integrating real-time weather updates, baseball stats, and demographic information, to scheduling events in a user's Google Calendar or posting updates on Twitter.

Bubble comes with three different API tools:

- The **Bubble API** comes with two tools for handling *inbound* API calls:
   - The **Data API** lets you invite other apps to read and write in your app's database
   - The **Workflow API** lets you invite other apps to run workflows in your app
- The **API Connector** is a plugin that lets you connect to external apps and services to make *outbound* calls

**Learn more:**

- Article: [Bubble API terminology](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/bubble-api-terminology)​

That's our whirlwind introduction to Bubble's core terminology! If it feels like a lot to take in at once, don't worry: as you start building, these terms will become second nature. They are consistently used around the editor to familiarize you with them as you go through your learning journey.
 Planning your first app

Many users who try out Bubble for the first time already have an idea of what they want to build. If you have never built an app before, the process of planning it out might seem daunting, but Bubble's intuitive design and workflow mechanisms are designed to guide beginners through the creation process seamlessly.

Starting with a clear vision is essential. Break down your idea into core functionalities and the interactions you expect users to have with your app. Sketching out a basic wireframe on paper or using a digital tool can help you visualize the layout and user journey. Even if it's just rough boxes and arrows, it'll give you a roadmap to follow.

Remember, the key to a successful app isn't just in its functionality, but also in its user experience. Consider the end-user at every stage of development.

In the next section, we'll have a look at how you can go about deciding what [features to include in your app](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/building-your-first-app/planning-features).

----
 Planning features

Before you start building, you need to decide what kind of features your app needs. Most app ideas start out as a general vision of what the app is supposed to do. You then take that vision and breaks it into the features needed to make that happen. When you've decided on the features you need, you can start planning how those features should work in an actual interface.

In this article, we'll cover:

- ​[What a features is](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/building-your-first-app/planning-featurewhat-is-a-feature)​
- ​[How to plan what features you want to include in the first version of your app](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/building-your-first-app/planning-featureplanning-features-for-your-mvp)​
- ​[Setting up user journeys to decide how a specific feature should work](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/building-your-first-app/planning-featurethe-user-journey)​
 What is a feature?

A **feature** is essentially a distinct function or capability that an app offers. It's what allows users to perform certain tasks or achieve specific outcomes within an app. They can broadly be categorized into two types: *general features* and *specific features*.
 General features

These are foundational features commonly found in a majority of apps across different genres. They form the basic infrastructure, facilitating the core user interactions.

Typical examples include:

- **User sign-up/sign-in**: allow users to create an account and log into the app
- **Reset password:** let users reset their password without you as the developer having to intervene
- **Notifications**: alert users about updates, messages, or other important information
- **Search bar**: let users search for content

General features are what makes your app *work*, but they're not what sets it apart. When you plan your app, it's a good idea to list these features as well, to make sure you have the full picture of the project ahead.
 Specific features

Specific features are unique to the nature and purpose of the app. They are linked closely with the app's core idea. For instance:

- For a food delivery app, a specific feature might be the ability for users to explore a restaurant's menu and add items to a cart
- In a language learning app, a custom vocabulary quiz tailored to a user's learning history could be a specific feature.
- For a budgeting app, a feature that projects future savings based on current spending habits might be included.

The specific features are what sets your app apart from other apps: the reason it's being developed in the first place. If your app exists to solve a problem, the app's features are *how* the problem will be solved.

Next, let's look at how you can prioritize features by thinking of your app in *versions*.
 Think in versions

It's useful to think of your app in versions, so that you know what exactly you are building. It's very easy to come up with new ideas as you work, and get sidetracked from your initial plan.

By planning out versions, you can stay focused on delivering a core set of features first, and then progressively enhance and expand your app based on feedback and actual user needs.

For example, you could think about your versions as follows:

**1. MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** This is the most basic version of your app, with only the essential features needed to make it functional. The goal here is to get something to market quickly to test the concept, gather feedback, and identify potential improvements and even pivots.

**2. Version 1.0:** Once you've validated the idea with your MVP, it's time to refine. This version will have improved UX/UI, and possibly some new features based on the feedback from your MVP. You'll also address any significant bugs or problems identified during the MVP phase.

**3. Version 2.0 (and beyond):** As your user base grows and you collect more feedback, you'll start to identify more areas for enhancement and expansion. This could involve adding new features, improving existing ones, or expanding into new markets or platforms.

Remember, it's tempting to want to add every feature you can think of from the get-go, but restraint can help you get your app to the market on schedule. Every time a good idea comes up, you can of course take note of it, and plan it into a future version.

Furthermore, taking a step-by-step approach allows you to adapt and pivot based on real-world feedback, rather than assumptions.

Users will often use your app in ways you hadn't anticipated or express needs you hadn't considered. By listening to them and iterating on your product, you increase the chances of your app's success in the long run.
 Planning features for your MVP

The first version of an app is often referred to as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The goal is to create something functional that effectively addresses the primary need or problem you've identified, without getting bogged down in secondary features or details.

Here's how you can approach this:

- **Identify the core problem:** What primary problem does your app aim to solve? Understanding this will help you prioritize the features that are absolutely necessary for your MVP.
- **User stories:** Draft user stories to envision how users will interact with your app. For example: "As a user, I want to be able to create new contacts so that I can keep track of my clients."
- **Prioritize features:** List all the features you envision for your app and then rank them based on their importance to the core problem. Focus on the top priorities for your MVP.
- **Sketch or wireframe:** Use sketches or wireframes to map out the user journey and interface. This visual aid will help you understand how the features integrate and flow together.
- **Feedback loop:** Share your prioritized feature list and wireframes with potential users, stakeholders, or teammates. Gather feedback and adjust your plan accordingly.
- **Avoid** **feature creep****:** It's tempting to add more features as you plan, but stay focused on the primary goal. Additional features can always be added in later versions once the MVP has been tested and validated.
- **Technical feasibility:** If you are unsure whether Bubble is the right platform for your project, you can get in touch with our [Success team](https://bubble.io/contact) or ask other users in our active [forum](https://forum.bubble.io/). Describe your idea and you can quickly get feedback on whether it's feasible.
- **Plan for feedback collection:** As the purpose of the MVP is to test and validate your idea, have mechanisms in place (like feedback forms, analytics tools, etc.) to gather user feedback once it's launched.

Even if Bubble is a very efficient tool to build in, don't be afraid to leave out features that are not absolutely needed to get your idea validated. You can always add those in later.
 The user journey

A user journey represents the series of steps or interactions a user undertakes to achieve a particular goal within your app or website. By mapping out these journeys, you can make sure that you have a plan for how users will reach a specific goal step-by-step.

When designing user journeys, start by envisioning a specific persona. *Who* is the individual embarking on this journey? Understanding this user's characteristics can guide you in tailoring the experience to suit their needs. For instance, while some users might be tech-savvy, others could benefit from more detailed instructions and a prominent call-to-action.
 Sign-up user journey

For example, you could set up a user journey for signing up to your app. This process can be a critical, as it often represents a user's first interaction with your app.

- **User persona**:
   - **Name**: Sarah
   - **Age**: 28
   - **Tech-savviness**: Moderate
   - **Goal**: To sign up for the app quickly and without hassles to explore its features.
- **Entry point**:

Sarah hears about the app in social media and decides to try it out

- **Opening the app**:

Sarah opens the app and is greeted with a welcome screen showcasing the app's main features.

- **Call to action**:

After the intro slides, Sarah sees two prominent buttons: "Sign Up" and "Log In."

- **Sign up option**:

Sarah clicks on "Sign Up" and is presented with options:

- "Sign Up with Email,"
- "Sign Up with Google,"
- "Sign Up with Facebook."
- **Choosing sign-up method**:

Wanting to keep things simple, Sarah chooses "Sign Up with Google."

- **Permissions**:

A prompt asks Sarah to allow the app to access her Google account info. She confirms.

- **Additional details**:

The app asks Sarah for a few more details to enhance her experience: her interests and preferences related to the app's features.

- **Confirmation and feedback**:

Once she provides the details, Sarah gets a success message: "Thank you for signing up, Sarah! Let's get started."

- **Profile setup** (optional step): Sarah is then prompted to complete her profile by adding a profile picture and other optional details.
- **First use experience**: After the onboarding, Sarah is directed to the app's main dashboard or home screen to start exploring.
- **Follow-up email**: Five minutes later, Sarah receives a welcome email reiterating the app's features and providing resources like FAQ and customer support links.

Throughout this journey, keep the following things in mind:

- Ensure that each step is intuitive and not overwhelming.
- Provide clear instructions and feedback.
- If needed, make it easy to ask for help.
- Keep the number of steps minimal, asking only for necessary information to ensure a high signup rate

While many sign-up processes look very similar, you don't need to see this as a blueprint: you are free to add or remove steps that you think make sense for your app. The idea is to know what the process should look like *before* you start building. This approach ensures you don't overlook crucial steps, making your development process as efficient as possible.

You can set up the user journey in steps, like we did in the example, but you can also use apps like [Miro](https://miro.com/), [Apple Freeform](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/12/apple-launches-freeform-a-powerful-new-app-designed-for-creative-collaboration/) or [Lucid](https://lucid.app/) to set it up more visually. Sometimes, good old pen and paper works best.

In the next section, we'll explore how you can think about the [data that you want to manage in your app](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/building-your-first-app/database-structure).

----
 Database structure

Now that you have decided on the features you want in your app, it's time to start thinking about how you structure your data. We won't go into the *technical* details on how to set that up just yet, but keep focusing on the planning stage.

We also have a long list of guides that go into detail on how to plan a database structure for a specific app category (like a project management app, marketplace app or blog). You can use this as inspiration for your project and learn how experienced Bubble developers think:

Article series: [Database structure by app type](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/database-structure-by-app-type)​
 Visualizing your data

When you plan your database structure, you should take notes. There are a range of different ways to do this, and there's really no "best practice". You should use whatever method makes sense to you.

For many users, simply noting things down with pen and paper or on a whiteboard is the most efficient way, at least for the first planning stage. You can also consider apps that focus on whiteboarding and diagrams, such as [Miro](https://miro.com/) and [Lucid.app](https://lucid.app/).

![sketch-of-a-diagram-2022-11-02-17-55-57-utc 2.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FvfESatLCZjrge0za0tuf%2Fsketch-of-a-diagram-2022-11-02-17-55-57-utc%202.jpg?alt=media&token=c9ac2f8b-3ce0-47aa-9d61-73e71289b19c)

Planning your database structure doesn't need fancy tools: use whatever you're comfortable with. Pen and paper works just fine.

Don't worry about taking notes in the "right" way: your goal is simply to get an understanding of what kind of data you want to store before you start building.
 The data types

Transitioning from SQL Databases? Here's what to know in Bubble.

In traditional databases, relationships between tables are commonly maintained through primary and foreign keys that act as unique identifiers. However, when learning Bubble, you'll notice that it's handled a bit differently.

Bubble simplifies database relations with its intuitive design. Rather than juggling keys, Bubble allows for direct linking of data types. This not only streamlines data management but also offers a more user-friendly and visual experience for those who don't have a background in database design. You can read more about this in the article section below.

Article section: [How the Bubble database is different from traditional databases](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-databashow-the-bubble-database-is-different-from-traditional-databases)​

If you are interested in learning more about the underlying technology that powers database, we also have a section that covers this:

Article section: [Technical information about the Bubble database](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-databastechnical-information-about-the-bubble-database)​

As you map out your database, you can still think of Bubble as a traditional relational database and plan your data types and relationships accordingly.

The data types make up the overarching types of data that you want to store in your app. Let's look at some examples to illustrate:

**Social media app** (see our detailed guide [here](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/database-structure-by-app-type/social-network-apps))

- Users
- Posts
- Interests

**Project management app** (see our detailed guide [here](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/database-structure-by-app-type/project-management-apps))

- Users
- Projects
- Tasks

**eCommerce app** (see our detailed guide [here](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/database-structure-by-app-type/online-store-ecommerce-apps))

- Users
- Products

These are of course not exhaustive lists, but serve as examples to show *what* a data type is. Think about the vision you have for your app, and try to plan out what kind of data you need to store to make it a helpful tool.

The fields

The *fields* are the data that you store in each data type. Fields can consist of different types of data, such as text, numbers, files, images and dates.

Let's repeat the examples from above and add some fields to those data types:

**Social media app** (see our detailed guide [here](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/database-structure-by-app-type/social-network-apps))

- Users
   - Name (text)
   - Date of birth (date)
   - Profile pic (image)
- Posts
   - Header
   - Content
- Interests
   - Name

**Project management app** (see our detailed guide [here](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/database-structure-by-app-type/project-management-apps))

- Users
   - Name (text)
   - Profile pic (image)
- Projects
   - Project name (text)
   - Project description (text)
- Tasks
   - Task name (text)
   - Task description (text)
   - Deadline (date)

**eCommerce app** (see our detailed guide [here](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/database-structure-by-app-type/online-store-ecommerce-apps))

- Users
   - Name (text)
   - Address (address)
- Products
   - Header (text)
   - Description (text)
   - Image (image)
   - Price (number)
- Shopping cart
 Relationships

Bubble's database is what's called a *relational database.* Relational simply means that different kinds of data can be *connected* somehow. For example, in a social media app, a post is *connected* to a user – that is, it "belongs" to the user that posted it.

This method is used in a range of different ways to structure how different types of data are related to each other. Relationships are just another field that's added to the data type. In the social media example, we could add a field to the *Post* data type, and that field is of type *User*. We can call that field whatever we want, such as *Owner*.

A relationship can contain *one* thing (i.e. a Post is connected to one owner), or a *list of things* (i.e. a Shopping cart contains a list of Products).

Let's again go over the earlier examples and see where it makes sense to connect data. We've marked the relationship fields in green.

**Social media app** (see our detailed guide [here](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/database-structure-by-app-type/social-network-apps))

- Users
   - Name (text)
   - Date of birth (date)
   - Profile pic (image)
   - Interests (list of Interests)
- Posts
   - Header
   - Content
   - Owner (User)
- Interests
   - Name

**Project management app** (see our detailed guide [here](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/database-structure-by-app-type/project-management-apps))

- Users
   - Name (text)
   - Profile pic (image)
- Projects
   - Project name (text)
   - Project description (text)
   - Owner (User)
   - Tasks (list of Tasks)
- Tasks
   - Task name (text)
   - Task description (text)
   - Deadline (date)
   - Owner (User)
   - Project (Project)

**eCommerce app** (see our detailed guide [here](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/database-structure-by-app-type/online-store-ecommerce-apps))

- Users
   - Name (text)
   - Address (address)
- Products
   - Header (text)
   - Description (text)
   - Image (image)
   - Price (number)
- Shopping cart
   - Owner (User)
   - Products (list of Products)

Don't worry about the technical side of this just yet – we'll cover that in detail in our [article series about the database](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database). Don't see this is a blueprint for setting up your app either – these are just simplified examples to get you into the right mindset:

- **Data types** are the overarching types of data in your app, such as users, tasks, products and blog posts
   - **Fields** contain the actual data stored in these types, such as name, phone number, description and image
- Data types can be **connected through relationships**, such as a shopping cart to an owner. These are just another field saved on the data type.

Keep in mind we are still in the planning stage. Planning out what kind of data you need your app to store will help you get a better understanding of how you can fulfil the vision that made you want to make an app in the first place.

Remember what we said in the first part of this section: most apps consist of a database at the bottom and a user interface on top of it. Now that we've covered the data, let's move on to the [Design and UX](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/building-your-first-app/design-and-ux) of your app.

----
 Design and UX

Unless you come from a design background, it can be difficult to know where to start. Luckily, there is an abundance of design resources both within the Bubble community and on the web in general.

Let's first quickly cover what exactly we *mean* by design.
 What is app design?

The short and easy answer is of course: design is what your app looks like. Let's break that down into some more detail.

The design process of an app can be categorized into two main disciplines:
 UI and UX

The **user interface** (often called UI) is the overall look of an app, including page layout, colors, typography, icons, images and other elements. Designing a user interface is about making the app look visually pleasing and aligned with the brand identity.

**User experience** design focuses on how the user perceives the app. Is it easy to navigate and use? Is it logical in its structure? Does it solve problems efficiently? UX design is rooted in understanding and optimizing the user's journey, ensuring that the interface is intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly.

So from this, we can draw up a few points that you can focus on in your design process:

- An app should look good and have a consistent design to represent your brand
- It should be easy to understand, navigate and use

Design is of course a wide and professional discipline. If you don't come from a design background, we recommend studying the work of great designers to get ideas and inspiration for your own work.
 Finding inspiration

Creating software that is easy to use and useful is both an art and a science. Have you given any thought as to why some apps feel like a natural extension of your brain, while others are frustratingly clunky? Great software feels intuitive, anticipates user needs, and delivers a delightful experience that keeps users coming back.

Behind every seamless app or platform is a meticulous combination of design thinking, understanding of user behavior, and technical prowess. Drawing inspiration from these standout pieces of software can guide your own app-building journey.

Study them, not just as a user, but as a creator. Dive deep into their user interface (UI), their user experience (UX), and the problems they solve. Ask yourself, why does a particular feature resonate with you?

Many app ideas will belong to one or more software categories. For example, if you are writing software to handle internal projects, inventory or HR in your company you can find a lot of inspiration in already existing software doing similar things.

Sometimes, great inspiration passes us by because we don't really reflect on *what* it is that makes it good. You will likely find things in these apps that you really like, and other things that you think could be improved – make it a habit to keep an eye out for clever solutions and good user experiences and ask yourself *why* it's good.
 Design resources
 Bubble resources

Bubble has a very active and helpful community that offers plenty of resources to get you started on your app's design.
 Templates

We have a large and growing catalogue of templates in our template store. Templates are not only about design, but often offer fully functioning apps that you can use as a springboard for your own project. Some templates focus on multi-purpose apps, while others serve specific niches, such as eCommerce, task management and landing pages.

Page: [Template store](https://bubble.io/templates)​
 Component library

The Component Library is a collection of pre-built User Interface (UI) components that can be dragged and dropped onto your page to help you build beautiful interfaces faster. These UI components are fully responsive and are made up of containers, visual elements, and form inputs that can be individually customized once added to your page.

Page: [The Component Library](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/the-component-library) Video: [Introducing the Component Library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dgmchu7S6o)​
 Showcase

Bubble hosts millions of apps, and you can easily find inspiration in our [Showcase](https://bubble.io/showcase). This is where we publish customer success stories.

Page: [Bubble showcase](https://bubble.io/showcase)​
 Third-party resources

From pre-designed templates to user interface guidelines, and from color palette generators to typography recommendations, there are tools and platforms dedicated to helping.

**1. Design templates:** Websites like [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/), [Envato elements](https://elements.envato.com/) or [Behance](https://www.behance.net/) showcase design works from professionals worldwide. These can serve as inspiration or even a starting point for your app’s interface. Some platforms also offer downloadable UI kits to give you a jumpstart.

**2. Color tools:** Websites like [Colormind](http://colormind.io/), [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel), or [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) can help you generate color schemes that look harmonious and pleasing to the eye. Understand the psychology of colors and pick a palette that aligns with your app's mood and purpose.

**3. Typography:** Tools like [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) or [FontPair](https://www.fontpair.co/) can help you pick the perfect font combinations for readability and aesthetics. Remember, typography plays a crucial role in user experience, so ensure your text is legible across devices.

**4. Icon libraries:** Need more icons than the built-in ones? Websites like [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/), [Iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/) offer vast libraries of icons that you can use to enhance your app's design. We also have plugins in the plugin store that offer more icons.

**5. Mockup and prototyping tools:** Platforms such as [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) or [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) allow you to create detailed mockups and interactive prototypes of your app. This helps visualize the end product. Bubble has a [tool for importing designs from Figma](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/importing-from-figma).

**6. Design guidelines:** For beginners, sticking to guidelines can be helpful. [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) (by Google) and [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/) (by Apple) provide principles and recommendations to create a consistent and intuitive user experience.

**7. Feedback platforms:** Websites like [UserTesting](https://www.usertesting.com/) or [Maze](https://maze.co/) can help you gather feedback on your designs from real users. Feedback at this stage can save countless hours of rework after development.

Lastly, remember that design isn’t just about aesthetics. Good design solves problems. It's about creating an intuitive, seamless experience for your users. As you dive deeper into design resources, keep the user's needs and behaviors at the forefront of your decisions. With the right tools and a user-centric mindset, you can craft a design that not only looks good but also feels right to your target audience.
 The design process

When your ideas are in place and after you've found the inspiration and resources needed to bring it to life, it's time to think about how to transfer that design to the screen. There are various methods to do this, and no right or wrong way. Decide for yourself what you're most comfortable with, and focus on getting to the finish line.
 The tools
 Pen and paper/post-its

Again, there is nothing wrong with using pen and paper during the first part of designing your app. Many users enjoy the freedom of not having to learn any new tools and the speed at which you can draw something directly on the page – and the feeling of throwing away stuff you no longer need.

![ux-mobile-application-wireframe-sketch-prototype-2022-12-29-00-49-35-utc-2.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FbMAlkBA7kpNgsCpTzLsi%2Fux-mobile-application-wireframe-sketch-prototype-2022-12-29-00-49-35-utc-2.jpg?alt=media&token=20b96599-d5e8-4068-80b6-23a140ceb25e)

Planning your app's design doesn't have to start on the screen – a sheet of paper, post-it notes and whiteboards are a great place to start sketching quickly.

Pen and paper is great for visualizing different parts of the user journey too. For example, when a user signs up, what fields do you need? How should that form look? How many fields are too many?
 Mockups/prototypes

Another method is to use mockup and prototyping tools (as suggested in point 5 in the above list). These are essentially visual tools that let you draw your ideas on the screen more in the way that you intend for them to look in the final app. Using a mockup tool like Figma can be highly useful as it offers real-time collaboration, cloud storage and the design can be imported directly into Bubble.

Your choice between using a prototyping tool or diving straight into Bubble largely hinges on your personal preferences and familiarity with such platforms. If you're wary of adding another layer of software mastery to your plate, you might choose to dive directly into Bubble's design environment instead.
 Designing in Bubble

Bubble comes with a visual WYSIWYG editor that's designed to help you place elements directly on a canvas and see the results immediately, similar to popular prototyping tools.

![signup.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FyojQBL32U84cYC52PydJ%2Fsignup.jpg?alt=media&token=65e913c8-4bea-4997-9078-8fa79f6e52f0)

Bubble's WYSIWYG editor makes it easy to see results immediately. With the instant [app preview](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/navigating-the-bubble-editor/previewing-your-app), you can see exactly what the app will look like to your users.

If you choose this approach when you plan your design, we strongly recommend reading through the [Design](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design) section of the manual to learn how Bubble's tools work. From there, we also link to video lessons that can get you quickly into the mindset of designing in Bubble.
 The UI kit

To keep your design process efficient, it's often a good idea to think about a UI kit. This is essentially a collection of elements that have consistent style attributes, which can include buttons, icons, form inputs, typography, and other elements.

If you want to set up and maintain a consistent design, we recommend going through this process first. Not only does it make it easier to be consistent in your design choices, but it can really speed up the design process overall, since you don't need to spend time on each individual element.

![laptop-bubble-editor-ui-kit.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FWyxmdtdf7ka0AgAu1f0M%2Flaptop-bubble-editor-ui-kit.png?alt=media&token=da5227c3-1c41-43b5-b412-6164d5a7fd36)

Setting up a UI kit can be as simple as placing and styling a few elements on a page, but it can make your design process a lot more efficient and consistent.

The idea is to think about the different elements that you will use in your app, and then set up their design in one place. This can be a page, or a reusable element for example. Whenever you need a specific button, you simply copy/paste it from that page to use it elsewhere.

You decide how detailed and advanced you want to be in your UI kit. Below we suggest a few different levels of complexity – if this is your first app, you may choose to only focus on the basics for example.

Think about all the design attributes that should consistently apply to an element, such as its color, border, shadow, width, height and font/font size.

**Start with the basics**

Focus on the fundamental components first:

- **Buttons**: These come in various sizes and states. Design for primary, secondary, and tertiary actions. A "Cancel" button is often less prominent than an "OK" button for example.
- **Input Fields**: Think about text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, and sliders.
- **Navigation**: Design navigation bars, sidebars, and tab bars.
- **Headers and body text:** text elements that are correctly formatted for headers and paragraphs

**Expand to complex components**

Once you have the basic components, it's time to tackle more complex ones:

- **Cards**: Commonly used to display snippets of information in an organized manner (such as the products in an eCommerce store)
- **Modals**: Pop-ups that grab the user's attention (alerts, confirmations, etc)
- **Tables**: Vital for displaying data. Consider pagination, sorting, and filters.

**Interactivity and states**

Users will interact with your interface, so account for various states:

- **Hover**: How does an element look when a user hovers over it?
- **Active**: What happens when an element is clicked?
- **Disabled**: Ensure users can recognize non-clickable or non-interactable components (i.e. a disabled button or input form)

**Save styles and style variables**

When you are happy with your UI kit, you can save the styling on the different elements as *styles*. This saves their styling attributes in a style that you can name, and then apply to other elements of the same time. We recommend that you set up styles *after* you have finished your UI kit, so that you can review your overall design first.

​Font variables and color variables can also help you keep track of your app's design.

**Add more elements as needed**

Whenever you need a new type of element, make a habit of adding it to your UI kit, so that you keep an updated "catalogue" of elements.

If you create your UI kit on a page, remember to remove that page before you deploy your app to live users (or they page will be accessible online). If you want to keep the UI kit without it being available to your end-users, you can place it inside of a reusable element instead.

Article: [Reusable elements](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/reusable-elements)​
 Building the page

When you are happy with your UI kit, you can start building your actual pages. Because you have invested some time to set up your initial colors, fonts and elements, you'll have a better feeling of how the app's overall look should be.

In the next section of the guide, we'll look into how you [Create and manage apps in Bubbl](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/creating-and-managing-apps)e, before moving onto covering the [Bubble editor](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/navigating-the-bubble-editor), its tabs, sections and tools and settings.

If you want to read more about how to use Bubble's design tools, you can continue directly to the [Design article series](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design).

 Creating and managing apps

This section covers how to create, manage and delete apps connected to your Bubble account
 Creating apps

To create a new app, go to the [*Apps* section](https://bubble.io/home/apps) of your Bubble account and click the *Create an app* button in the upper right corner.

![create-app-step-1@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FdXWqthvCGiqBAmxBU41S%2Fcreate-app-step-1%402x.png?alt=media&token=4ba6ed6b-c156-4532-988b-a8bbb0b467c2)

You will be asked to give your app a name and whether you want to create an app from a template.

To build an app from a template, you first need to add one or more templates from the [Template marketplace](https://bubble.io/templates) to your account. You can then select a template from the Create app dropdown.
 App names

When you give your app a new (such as my-bubble-application), that name is reserved and a unique URL is generated. The name is held and used by Bubble for indexing purposes, which means:

- The **name cannot be changed** after it's set
- The **name cannot be reused** in another app by you or anyone else, even after the app is deleted

The app name is visible in your app's default URL, such as:

`https://my-bubble-application.bubbleapps.io`

Once you are on a custom domain, the app name is no longer visible anywhere in your live app.
 What is created?

Everything needed to start building your application is automatically set up when you create a new app:

- Your app gets a **unique URL** based on the name you gave it
- The **default pages** are set up, such as index and 404 pages.
- **Two databases** (one for Development and one for Live)
- Any **template** you selected (if any) is automatically applied
 Onboarding

If you are new to Bubble or want a repeat of the basics, you may find our onboarding tools useful. The onboarding wizard is available whenever you create a new app.
 Managing apps
 App plans

Each app is connected to a pricing plan of your choice, to ensure that you can work on multiple projects that are in different stages of its life cycle, growth and requirements. You can read more about the plans in our [Account and Billing](https://manual.bubble.io/account-and-marketplace/account-and-billing) section.
 Deleting an app

If you no longer need an app, you can delete it completely from your account.

**Implications of deleting an app**

It's very important that you understand the implications of deleting an app before going through with it. Please read the section below carefully.

- Once an app is deleted, it cannot be recovered, even by the Bubble team
- The app's name is locked even after it's deleted – don't delete an app in an attempt to free up the name (the app name is only visible to your users in your app's default URL)
- All details related to your app are deleted without exceptions (including the databases)

**How do delete an app**

To delete an app, first locate it in the [*Apps* section](https://bubble.io/home/apps) of your Bubble account. Make sure you are logged in first.

Click the pullout menu symbol as illustrated below:

​

![delete-app-step-1@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F3zA1AIvgvjtGeAsiYtbp%2Fdelete-app-step-1%402x.png?alt=media&token=7076aa91-d581-47de-a519-31b68179b9fa)

First, click the pullout menu symbol next to the app name to see the app's properties and relevant actions.

Then, click the delete button at the bottom of the pullout menu:

![delete-app-step-2@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FEBUTd0NJSxjwxhV3ylCp%2Fdelete-app-step-2%402x.png?alt=media&token=7080d40e-eae5-4231-b9e2-29f3c55832f3)

In the pullout menu, click the *Delete app* button to start the deletion process.

After clicking the *Delete app* button you will be asked a security question to confirm the process. Deleting the app can take up to a few minutes, depending on its complexity and the size of its database.

**Who can delete an app?**

Only administrators can delete an application. If you cannot see the *Delete app* button, it means you don't have the sufficient access level to delete it.
 Duplicating an app

You can also make an exact copy of an application. To duplicate an app, first locate it in the [*Apps* section](https://bubble.io/home/apps) of your Bubble account. Make sure you are logged in first.

Click the pullout menu symbol as illustrated below:

​

![delete-app-step-1@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F3zA1AIvgvjtGeAsiYtbp%2Fdelete-app-step-1%402x.png?alt=media&token=7076aa91-d581-47de-a519-31b68179b9fa)

First, click the pullout menu symbol next to the app name to see the app's properties and relevant actions.

Then, click the *Duplicate app* button at the bottom of the pullout menu:

![delete-app-step-2@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FkxMbl1Szo92OUYu9lFMp%2Fdelete-app-step-2%402x.png?alt=media&token=dfb57a7a-ad84-4941-bcc3-0fa07250cdc6)

You will be asked to give the duplicate app a name, and whether to copy the content of the database as well.

Copying the database can have implications for the privacy of your app's users: keep in mind that both the Development and Live databases are copied, potentially including sensitive data.

If you decide not to copy the database, you will not be able to do so later without manually exporting and importing it. We recommend giving careful thought as to include it or not.
 Collaboration

If you are added to an app as a collaborator, you will also see it in your list of app. The same is true for anyone that you add as a collaborator to one of your applications.

You can read more about Collaboration in our [dedicated article](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/maintaining-an-application/collaboration).
 The agency plan

The agency plan is made for developers and teams that build apps for others, and grants broader access to collaboration across multiple apps.

See our article on [Building apps for others](https://manual.bubble.io/account-and-marketplace/account-and-billing/building-apps-for-others) for more information on the agency plan.

 The Bubble editor

This section covers how to navigate the Bubble editor

The Bubble editor refers to the editor connected to any one app (as opposed to the dashboard where you navigate your different apps and manage your account).

[](https://youtu.be/uG8KuvAIeyg?list=PLoNVJrdvQQYlGHGcKDCpbgAv1lruNA8db)

Our Academy course to introduce you to Bubble and its interface.

**Multiple browser tabs editing the same app**

Opening the Bubble editor for the same app in multiple browser tabs might result in unexpected behavior. We recommend keeping the editor of an app limited to just one tab at a time.

The Bubble editor is like a digital workshop where you build and design your app. Think of it as a crafting table where you arrange, tweak, and connect different parts to make your app look and work just the way you want.

We will go into the technical details of design, data and logic in later chapters, but for now we'll cover how the editor is structured, and the different tools available.

**Tabs and sections: how the editor is structured**

First, we'll explore the basic structure of the editor and how to navigate it. The editor is divided into tabs, and some of those tabs are further divided into sections.

Article: [Tabs and sections](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/navigating-the-bubble-editor/tabs-and-sections)​

**Key features: Saving, undo, navigation and contextual menus**

Next, we'll look into basic functionality like saving, undo/redo and using the Bubble toolbar and right-click contextual menus.

Article: [Key features](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/navigating-the-bubble-editor/tools/key-features)​

**Tools: the property editor, search tool and issue tracker**

Then, we'll have a look at the most widely used tools in the editor. The property editor is used to change the properties of elements on the page. The search tool is an advanced tool to search for a wide range of different objects in your app and the issue tracker helps you identify and fix issues.

Article: [The property editor](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/navigating-the-bubble-editor/tabs-and-sections/design-tab/the-property-editor) Article: [The search tool](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/navigating-the-bubble-editor/tools/the-search-tool) Article: [The issue tracker](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/navigating-the-bubble-editor/tools/the-issue-tracker)​

**Previewing and deploying: running your app with test and live users**

Bubble comes with a built-in tool to preview your app. This Development environment comes with a completely independent database and lets you try out your app and all its features before deploying it to live users.

Deploying your app means transferring or updating the current version of your application from the Development environment to the Live environment, making it accessible to end-users.

 Tabs and sections

The Bubble editor is organized into *tabs* that align with the different aspects of app development, such as design, data management, style customization, and technical settings/logs. Some tabs are further segmented into *sections*.

**Tabs** are navigated using the left-hand menu that remains visible at all times.

![laptop-bubble-editor.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FAEKSev0YHut0nK8TTkKT%2Flaptop-bubble-editor.png?alt=media&token=fdd3550c-2b38-4d46-b28a-a5f68ffacc41)

The left-hand bar gives you quick access to all **tabs** in the Bubble editor at all times.

​

**Sections** (when available) are navigated using the menu that is visible at the top of the currently active tab:

![laptop-bubble-editor-sections.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F4nMB2YU33t1NOiUX2BJT%2Flaptop-bubble-editor-sections.png?alt=media&token=0552fee1-cac6-423f-85bd-4cc84dced2e6)

Some tabs are further divided into **sections** relevant for that tab.

These two bars make up the Bubble editor navigation, and contain the following tabs and sections:
 Design

The design tab is where you design pages in your app by adding elements such as text, images, buttons and icons.

Article: [The Design tab](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/navigating-the-bubble-editor/tabs-and-sections/design-tab) Article series: [Design](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design)​
 Workflow

The workflow tab is where you set up events and actions to instruct Bubble what to do as the user interacts with your app, such as what happens when a button is clicked.

Article: [The Workflow tab](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/navigating-the-bubble-editor/tabs-and-sections/workflow-tab) Article series: [Workflows](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/workflows)​

**The backend workflow editor**

If you have enabled the Workflow API in your app, you can access the backend workflow editor by using the *Pages* dropdown and clicking the *Backend workflows* link at the bottom. You can learn more in the links below. If you are just starting to learn Bubble, this is a more advanced topic.

 Styles

**Element styles**

Element styles are collections of style settings that you can apply to elements, including color, shadow, font, borders and responsive behavior.

 Design tab

Bubble introduced a new responsive engine in 2021. If you have an older app, you may still see the legacy engine and its properties. We recommend that you update your app to the new responsive engine. The documentation for the legacy responsive engine is available in the link below.

Article series: [Responsive design (legacy)](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/responsive-design/legacy-articles)​
 The UI builder

The UI Builder is your workspace for crafting and tweaking visual components on your app's pages.

Using Bubble's intuitive WYSIWYG editor, you can visualize how elements will appear to your app's end-users. As you design, keep in mind that elements, including containers and visual elements, come with layout settings to ensure responsive designs.

By default, every Bubble app includes certain pages such as the 404 page, displayed when users access a non-existent URL on your app, and the reset_pw page for password resets. To manage multiple pages or dive into reusable components, navigate using the dropdown on the top left of the top bar.

Article series: [Design](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design)​
 The element tree

The element tree displays all the components present on the page. Indentation indicates a hierarchy, where an element resides within a container. Note that elements can be nested multiple times, like groups inside groups, and so on.

​

![laptop-bubble-editor-element-tree.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FcwSDQwIVMdK1y2qDoL83%2Flaptop-bubble-editor-element-tree.png?alt=media&token=ed4b590a-f17d-4910-9760-65e51b5a7229)

The element tree shows all elements on the page in a hierarchy.

Article: [The element tree](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/the-element-hierarchy/the-element-tree)​
 The element pallet

The element pallet lists all the elements that you can place on the page. Bubble comes with a long list of different elements, and more can be added with plugins.

![laptop-bubble-editor-element-pallet.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FQqRKRdRzJvCE5Hw6pthV%2Flaptop-bubble-editor-element-pallet.png?alt=media&token=9fdccd53-e0db-4992-99ba-34de742dc0c9)

The element pallet contains all the different types of elements you can add to the page.

Elements are divided into categories for easy navigation:

- Visual elements
- Containers
- Input forms
- Reusable elements

You can also use the search bar to quickly find the element you are looking for. To place an element on the page:

- Drag the element from the element pallet
- Click the element in the element pallet and then "draw" it on the page

Article series: [Elements](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements)​
 Responsive

You can switch the Design tab from UI Builder mode to the Responsive mode. Responsive settings refer to the configuration of how the page is displayed on varying screen widths - how the layout 'responds' to changing widths. As such, the Responsive tab allows you to quickly get a sense of how your page layout will respond depending on the screen size without previewing it live.

![laptop-bubble-editor-responsive.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FXon0nuw06ZYcwkqCbjYn%2Flaptop-bubble-editor-responsive.png?alt=media&token=3af0656a-75d4-4311-b826-3623c6bae6b1)

Switching between *Design* mode and *Responsive* mode lets you tweak the page's responsive behavior.

At the top of the left flyout of this sub-tab, there are shortcuts to snap the page width to different common screen widths, e.g. mobile portrait, mobile landscape, tablet and laptop. You can also change the page width to any arbitrary width using the ruler at the top.

The responsive type will also show you the current size of the selected element as well as its parent.

 The element tree

This section covers the element tree found in the Design tab of the Bubble editor.

As we explored in the section about *elements*, all objects you place on the page become a part of that pages hierarchical structure. Another way to describe it is as a *parent-child* relationship: any elements that you place within a group become a child of that group.

The element tree displays all the elements on the current page organized into parent-child relationships. The top parent element is the page, and all the groups and elements you place on that page are its children.

![element-tree@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F0p2GsFQMc7koVr5UQ1OG%2Felement-tree%402x.png?alt=media&token=ec102a24-e63c-4722-a282-bbef93bf2c93)
 Element tree modes

The Element Tree has two modes. You can either decide to show all elements on the page in a tree view, with parents and children, or only show hideable elements. Hideable elements are elements that are hidden on page load (from which you have unchecked the box 'This is element is visible on page load' in that elements Property Editor).

![CleanShot 2023-02-06 at 11.57.29.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FnQpFdRxNKEXxwYCcutEK%2FCleanShot%202023-02-06%20at%2011.57.29.png?alt=media&token=d6bc6cd0-b079-4e43-89af-7ab2d67c15f1)

Checking *Only show hideable elements* lets you quickly identify elements that are hidden.

In other words, you will only see these elements in the list when the option 'only show hideable elements' is checked. This is a useful feature when editing a page because it lets you quickly show elements that aren't visible for editing purposes, while the other mode is useful to get a full view of the page.
 Moving elements in the hierarchy

The element tree show an element's place in the hierarchy. If the element is placed within a group, it will be displayed in the tree as a child of that group.

![move-elements.gif](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F4amyZvsEn3FoBAktH5VE%2Fmove-elements.gif?alt=media&token=009209bf-ba03-4ac0-a25e-0ce58dd69233)

The blue line shows you where in the hieararchy you are.

You can drag and drop elements in the element tree to change their place in the hierarcy. For example, you can drag it from one group into another. If you drag a group that contains other elements, all those elements will be moved along with it.

Dragging and dropping elements in the element tree is only supported if the page is built with the [responsive engine](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/the-element-hierarchy/the-element-tree).

 The page

The page is the blank canvas on which you design your app's user interface.

At the core of everything related to design and user interface in Bubble is the **page.**

This is the canvas on which you place input elements, text, images, icons, videos and everything else that your users need to make use of your app.

![bubble-devices.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FtO5DIzocXxBa24t5qUj1%2Fbubble-devices.jpg?alt=media&token=03f36c7e-d0bd-4a21-8bae-ef30ee436208)

The page gives you a blank canvas on which to build your vision.
 What is a page?

No matter what kind of application you want to build, from a simple website to a complex eCommerce platform, the page remains the starting point for all your design and development efforts. You can see the page itself as the lowest level in the hierarchy of a page's structure, where every element you add to it is contained within that page.

**What is a page's hierarchy structure?**

A Bubble page is composed of three types of components:

- The page The page is the top-level component of a webpage and is responsible for organizing the groups and elements on the page. **The page is the top container for all elements**
- Groups: Groups are used to group elements together and control their layout. They can be thought of as "boxes" that hold other elements. They can be styled or they can be invisible to the user and can contain Elements and even other Groups to create a hierarchy. Groups are a major part of your page's design as they determine how your other elements behave. **Groups are containers for elements and for sub-groups**
- Elements Elements are the actual content that your users see and interact with to work with your app, such as buttons, links, images, icons and input fields. **Elements are the things that users interact with on the page**

The way in which these components are organized and styled determines the overall layout and design. From a technical viewpoint they make up the page's hierarchy structure.

It helps to see it in a schematic form:

![bubble-page-hierarchy.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FBNrAMQQt7jTQIgw88Ehy%2Fbubble-page-hierarchy.jpeg?alt=media&token=f8a66c58-c08b-4311-8a48-56883316de5f)

​

In a way, the hierarchy above is how your browser "sees" the page before rendering the results on the screen.

You can read more about the element hierarchy in the article below:

Article: [The element hierarchy](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/the-element-hierarchy)​
 Default pages

When you create a new Bubble application, a few pages are included by default. These pages have a few traits in common:

- They are always present when your app is created
- You cannot change their names
- You cannot delete them
 index

The index page is the main page of your app (more on that [below](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/the-pagthe-index-page)).
 404

The 404 page is where your users are taken if they type in an URL in the URL bar that includes your domain, but the page name they enter doesn't exist:

[https://appname.bubbleapps.io/non-existing-page](https://appname.bubbleapps.io/non-existing-page)

The 404 is an http error code that is used to tell your browser that the page doesn't exists.

![bubble-404.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FqpWDqwZnlg8H4ZCehSlV%2Fbubble-404.jpeg?alt=media&token=7bdd8358-585e-484e-810a-cdac479c2fb1)

The 404 page can be edited freely just like any other page – but it can't be deleted.

You can use this page to tell your users that the page couldn't be found and point them in another direction.
 reset_pw

This is the page to which your users are directed if they need to reset their password. They will most likely follow a link in a reset password email to this page.

![reset-pw.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FGAtP6KAP1T9C6DzBvLHq%2Freset-pw.jpeg?alt=media&token=415b8631-aeb6-4eea-96c0-1059f000d13b)

The reset_pw page is a special page that lets your users reset their password safely. It's part of Bubble's core functionality and can't be removed or renamed.

​
 The index page

The index page is the main page of your application – the first page that will load when a user types in your app's domain in the browser's URL bar. It's also the only page that can be displayed *without* showing the page's name.

For example, the below URL's would take you to the index page even if you are not including the page's name in the URL:
 No custom domain

| **Version**     | **URL**                                                                                  |

| **Live**        | [https://appname.bubbleapps.io](https://appname.bubbleapps.io)                           |

Custom domain

| **Version**     | **URL**                                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Development** | [https://www.mydomain.com/version-test](https://www.mydomain.com/version-test) |
| **Live**        | [https://www.mydomain.com](https://www.mydomain.com)                           |

If your app has any custom branches set up in version control, the *version-test* part of the URL is replaced by the ID of the currently active branch.
 Setting an index page

When you create an app in Bubble, the index page is created automatically. You cannot name another page index, but you can replace it by using the *Make this page the new index* function.

![change-index@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F6zxHQisSUnsDVMLE6vYj%2Fchange-index%402x.png?alt=media&token=ea62f101-13f3-420f-8c2b-776eef079bfb)

The old index page will be named *old_index.*

Video lesson
 The page URL

Every page that you add automatically has a unique URL assigned that your users can access to visit that page, just like any other website. All pages follow the same URL pattern: by combining the root URL of your application with the name of the page:
 No custom domain

| **Version**     | **URL**                                                                                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Development** | [https://myapp.bubbleapps.io/version-test/](https://myapp.bubbleapps.io/version-test/)**page-name** |
| **Live**        | [https://myapp.bubbleapps.io/](https://myapp.bubbleapps.io/)**page-name**                           |
 Custom domain

If you have connected your app to a custom domain, the URL will look like this:

| **Version**     | **URL**                                                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Development** | [https://mydomain.com/version-test/](https://mydomain.com/version-test/)**page-name** |
| **Live**        | [https://mydomain.com/](https://mydomain.com/)**page-name**                           |

If your app has any custom branches set up in version control, the *version-test* part of the URL is replaced by the ID of the currently active branch.
 Creating a new page

To create a new page, click the dropdown in the upper left corner of the Bubble editor, right next to the Bubble logo. In the dropdown, click *Add a new page...*

![bubble-add-new-page@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FZhsbeMUIsDX8a7htRRX2%2Fbubble-add-new-page%402x.png?alt=media&token=0c322129-d764-46e1-9122-2f96f21f9488)

You will be asked to provide a name for the new page and whether you want to [clone an existing page](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/the-pagcloning-a-page).

![name-page-bubble@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FQqZMMc3fctqSIBWwtJ9B%2Fname-page-bubble%402x.png?alt=media&token=0c288106-6bc5-48f1-a797-29200747b032)

You can give your page any name you want, as long as it's URL safe and unique in this application.
 Naming your pages

You can create as many pages in your app as long as they have unique names. Keep in mind when naming pages that they need to be URL safe. Any non-URL safe strings you provide will automatically be URL encoded.

A simple rule of thumb for page names is to only use the english letters a-z and numbers 0-9 and replace spaces with dashes. During URL encoding, Bubble will:

- change the text to lowercase
- replace spaces with -

 Cloning a page

Cloning a page means to create an exact copy of that page under a new name. The entire page, including all elements and workflows will be copied.

There are two ways to clone a page:

By selecting *Add new page...*

![bubble-add-new-page@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FZhsbeMUIsDX8a7htRRX2%2Fbubble-add-new-page%402x.png?alt=media&token=0c322129-d764-46e1-9122-2f96f21f9488)

To clone a page, you can use the *Add new page...* menu item

... or by having the page you want to clone open in the editor and selecting *Edit - Clone this page:*

![clone-page@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FDB4MsdKTCBzxQ7UKpgUH%2Fclone-page%402x.png?alt=media&token=a00cbda8-1249-4091-9974-3e22cd84c7e0)

You can also clone the page by selecting *Clone this page* while having the page you want to clone open in the editor.

Regardless of the method you choose, you will be asked to provide a name for the clone and confirm which page to clone in the page dropdown marked below:

![name-page-bubble@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FqaNxA5rH92P1xA045RF9%2Fname-page-bubble%402x.png?alt=media&token=82fe75e6-fec1-4635-8749-3eac37c5c89e)
 Page properties

Each page can have their own individual settings configured that affects how that page looks and behaves. Settings are available in the **Property Editor.**

There are two ways to access the page settings:

- Double-click with the left mouse button anywhere on the page itself (avoid clicking on another group or element
- Clicking on the page in the page's element tree:

![element-tree-page-element@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fo2ZH0LsbTawxQtZVASue%2Felement-tree-page-element%402x.png?alt=media&token=2cfdca82-366a-465f-b8cb-bace3896e785)

Using the *element tree* you can easily access the Property Editor of the page – or any other element.

​

For the full list of all the settings for the page, see our [page settings core reference.](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/page-element)​

The page's settings are available in the Property Editor, as illustrated below:

![page-property-editor@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F7ny5XirUwrWPs4E3X3jY%2Fpage-property-editor%402x.png?alt=media&token=7fd8b62c-0ff3-4ee6-9942-6e8e0070e120)
 Appearance

The *Appearance* tab lets you control the visual properties of the page, such as the background style and colors, as well as what kind of data the page should hold and its SEO metadata.
 Layout

The *Layout* tab lets you control the page's responsive properties, or how it's layout is structured and changes across different screen sizes. You can read more about layouts in our guide on [responsive design](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/responsive-design).
 Conditions

The *Conditions* tab lets you change the Page title and background styling if one or more certain conditions are true. You can read more about this in our article on [Conditions](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/conditions).
 Organizing your pages

Pages can be organized into folders in the Bubble editor to make them easier to find.

Organizing pages into folders makes it easier to find the pages you need to open in the editor, but they do not affect the URL or navigation experience of the page in your app.
 Adding a page to a folder

To move a page into a specific folder, do the following:

- Open the Property Editor for the page by double-clicking anywhere on the page itself (not on another group or element)
- In the Property Editor, navigate to the *Appearance* tab and scroll to the bottom:

![page-property-inspector@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FllK8USws6ila02GQo88C%2Fpage-property-inspector%402x.png?alt=media&token=a070e743-aba5-458e-b56a-a845f82ad9d0)

​

- Pick a folder, or create a new one. You can leave the dropdown blank to remove it from a folder.
 Navigating your folders

You will find all the folders you create in the upper right corner of the page navigator (which is located in the top left corner of the Bubble editor).

![navigating-page-folders-bubble@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fpv4YJRdbgYyFflkdDhEY%2Fnavigating-page-folders-bubble%402x.png?alt=media&token=97f57e2a-7ba7-4fce-8f2c-f60b20b6e728)

Folders let you organize the pages in your app to make them easier to find. Folders do not affect the URL of the page in your Bubble app.

 Frequently asked questions

**Can I add page folders to my URL structure?**

Bubble does not support page folders in your app's URL's. As such, all pages follow the same structure as [described above](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/the-pagthe-page-url).

**Can I publish and un-publish pages?**

All pages are public, meaning that as soon as you have created one, they can be accessed in your app. Keep in mind that changes need to be deployed before they are visible in your live app – this applies to pages too.

If you'd like to keep the elements on a page but not make the page available to your users, you can convert the contents of the page into a reusable element and store them there.

**How do I navigate between pages?**

To send a user to another page, you can use the [*Go to page*](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/navigatiogo-to-page-...) action or the [link](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/visual-elementlink) element.

 Containers

This section covers the container elements, used to group and control the behavior of other elements

> > This section takes a long-form look at what containers are and how you can use them in different situations. To see the full list of settings available on container elements, you can check out our more concise [core reference entry on containers](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/containers).

![edit-user.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FuvdrIhMFyMfGpzyT9DKl%2Fedit-user.jpg?alt=media&token=ffd29bfd-c79b-422b-8967-ec57d12d35c6)

Containers can hold elements like the form in the example above. Here we're using a [*group*](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers/groups) element.

All elements on your page are part of a hierarchy with the page as the top parent.

Containers are used to contain elements and control how they behave on the page. You can place elements inside of a container, making it the parent and the element(s) its children. The element tree will display the hierarchy of the parent-child relationship.

Bubble has six container types that behave in different ways. Knowing how the different types behave is the key to mastering design in Bubble, so we recommend spending some time getting to know their behavior.

Click on each container type for more information and a link to the full article:

Groups – placed directly on the page to build the page hierarchy

Groups are the most basic container type and can be placed directly on the page to build a hierarchy of parent-child relationships. They are used to contain elements, control responsive behavior, navigation and to hold data.

Article: [Groups](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers/groups)​

Repeating groups – used to display lists of things in a flexible design

Repeating groups are similar to groups, but will repeat its content once for each item in a list of things such as database records. Repeating groups are used to display lists such as (but not limited to) a list of users, a search result, product cards and photo masonry grids. A repeating group allows you to design lists in a flexible way, and the table element (below) lets you set up a more structured table with fixed row/column headers. Article: [Repeating Groups](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers/repeating-groups)​

Table element - used to display a list of things in neat rows and columns

Table elements are similar to repeating groups in that it shows a list of things, but unlike the repeating group container a table can have fixed row/column headers and is useful for setting up more strict table-like structures.

Article: [The Table element](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers/table-elements)​

Popups – display a group above all other elements (i.e. a message or signup form)

The *Popup* group type is a a group that is displayed above all other elements and is centered on the screen regardless of the scrolling position of the page. They can be set up to hide or blur the page below. As such, they are a useful way to bring an important message or forms to the user's attention immediately.

Article: [Popups](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers/popups)​

Floating groups – hovers above page attached to a screen edge (i.e. navigation bar)

Floating Groups are a group type that can be set up to hover above other elements on the page and they can be attached to any side of the screen and stay there regardless of whether the user scrolls up and down.

Article: [Floating Groups](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers/floating-groups)​

Group focus – remains visible as long as it's in focus (i.e. dropdown menu)

The Group Focus has two main characteristics:

- It will remain visible only for as long as it is in focus. *Focus* in this context means until you click anywhere else on the page.
- They are displayed relative to another element by a set number of pixels

This makes the Group Focus very useful for things like dropdown menus, contextual menus and tooltips.

Article: [Group Focus](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers/group-focus)​

​
 Styling containers

Containers can be set to be invisible, but they can also have a background style, roundness, borders and shadows, just like other elements.

![group-styling.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FsmVmNFcWymMmTywHrZtw%2Fgroup-styling.jpeg?alt=media&token=47bff6fe-2a10-4005-b282-2d3541fd8b98)

Groups can be invisible, like on the left, or they can be styled. The right group has a white background color, rounded corners and a shadow.

You access a group's styling settings by double-clicking it or by clicking on it in the element tree.
 Loading data into containers

Containers are not just visual elements; they can also be used to hold different kinds of data. For example, if you are working on a form that lets you edit a user (with input fields for name, phone number and address), you can set the containers data source to *User* and load the user data into the container.

The data loaded into the container is then made available to all of its child elements. This allows you to load specific data into parts of a page, such as in the example below where we are loading the data about a user into the container:

![load-group-data@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FbkQXKjjqninxQpkFbByw%2Fload-group-data%402x.png?alt=media&token=377b7db3-eaf0-48aa-a3e6-2802369f30d4)

You can load data into a group to easily reference it in other elements and workflows.
 Referencing data in elements

In the example above, we have loaded the current user into the container, and it lets us easily reference the user in the input elements in the form:

![parent-group-data@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FPLRlT4kQiL52tCM1bqpr%2Fparent-group-data%402x.png?alt=media&token=01879804-44b7-4edf-9eff-43519cba5762)

By loading data into a group we can reference that data in the group's child elements. In the example above we're loading the user's name into an input field.

In the illustration above, the container is loading the current user, and we can use that information in the container's child elements. In the screenshot, we're looking at the settings for the input field. We're referencing the *Parent groups's User's name*.
 Referencing data in workflows

The same can be done with workflows. In the example below, we want the *Save changes* button to save the data from the input fields to the database. By referencing the parent group's user, we can save it easily:

![save-to-parent-thing@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fs7USTOFyiZWIBRc1479r%2Fsave-to-parent-thing%402x.png?alt=media&token=36b720e2-c390-486e-b199-daf82926ff13)

If an element like a button is placed within a group that holds data, we can reference that data in workflows connected to that element. In the example above we're referencing the user loaded into the parent group of the button.

Referencing the parent group's data in a workflow requires that the event that triggers the workflow is connected to one of the container's child elements. For example, a Save button inside of the container could trigger a workflow that saves changes from the form.

Referencing data in elements and workflows can be done on all group types, including the cells of a Repeating Group.
 Different ways of loading data

There are two different ways to load data into a container:

- You can set the *Data source* of the container to load data. In the example above we are loading the *Current user*, but you can also fetch it in other ways, such as performing a database search using *Do a search for.*

![data-source.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FtAcvKmuOBXfwjBS9krPs%2Fdata-source.png?alt=media&token=68f4dee8-b6a0-4c92-ab5b-6795bb8bea88)

Setting the *Type of content* to User and the *Data source* to Current user instructs Bubble to load the data about the current user into the container

- You can use a workflow to push data to the container. This is useful when you want the loading of data to be the result of a user action.

![load-data-into-group@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FDA1M8ZYKfsuj8LQyUDE8%2Fload-data-into-group%402x.png?alt=media&token=0556a4d0-b0e3-4665-bf9a-a61d8ca712db)

In this example we are using the *Display data in group/popup* action to search for a user and load its data into the group. We'll then be able to reference the loaded user in elements and workflows contained within the group.

The first method will load the data as soon as the page is loaded, while the second will await a trigger to execute the workflow. You could also use the latter method to allow the user to select which user they want to edit.

​
 Resetting a container

You can reset a container to wipe the thing that is displayed in it. When you use a reset group action, the thing will be reverted to what was defined as the datasource. This is useful to note since reset doesn't mean *empty* – it means reset to its initial state.

![reset-group.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FtmODodqspFbD691Mso9j%2Freset-group.png?alt=media&token=c6362875-df2f-46f7-afd2-1fd7ea72a2fb)

Whenever you change the content of a container, it's effectively being reset and displaying the new thing. This means that all child elements (such as input fields containing text) will update their content to reflect the data being loaded into its parent container.

Note that whenever the content of a group changes, the group effectively is being reset and a new thing is being displayed in it.
 Groups and responsive settings

You can use groups to control the responsive behavior of the elements inside of it. For example, if you have three input fields that you want to never be more than 200 pixels wide, you can set the maximum width on the group that holds them. That way, the max width are applied to all of the elements and you don't need to apply it one by one.

You can read more about responsive design in our Responsive design article series. Article series: [Responsive design](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/responsive-design)​

Using groups to control responsive behavior is the key to efficiently set up a responsive design.

![responsive-group@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FcZF4ryvT96H7mJoF8NHp%2Fresponsive-group%402x.png?alt=media&token=2efacebd-4e76-4112-ab36-a3a62be231b2)

In this example, we have set the max width of the group to be 480 pixels. This way, we also control the width of the elements inside of that group.

​

----
 Groups

This section covers Groups, that can be used to contain elements and data and control the responsive behavior of child elements

Groups are the most basic container type. It can be placed anywhere on the page, including inside of another container.

[](https://youtu.be/HWmgmzIQRfg)

It can be used to organize other elements, for aesthetic purposes (by styling it) and to pass data.

![edit-user.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FuvdrIhMFyMfGpzyT9DKl%2Fedit-user.jpg?alt=media&token=ffd29bfd-c79b-422b-8967-ec57d12d35c6)

Groups can hold elements like the form in the example above.
 Using groups for navigation

Groups can be displayed and hidden based on different conditions and user actions. By hiding and showing groups that contain other elements you can let your users navigate your app without having to go to another page.

When a group is hidden, you can set it to collapse its height and width to give room for other groups to be displayed. To the user, the switch is instant – the content on the page simply seems to change without any delay or flickering.

![toggle-groups.gif](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FlM46U8z6iNgVKbhMYGOW%2Ftoggle-groups.gif?alt=media&token=b77548af-615b-4a05-aae6-cde2d1bb70cb)

In the example above, we are toggling the visibility of Group A and Group B.

In the animation above we are toggling the visibility of Group A and Group B. The result is that one replaces the other as the blue group collapses its height. This is how you build single-page applications (often abbreviated to SPA) where users can visit different sections of the page while never having to reload.

There are two ways to hide and show groups: conditions and actions.
 Using conditions

The first way is to place conditions on the group that looks for specific criteria to be true. A common way to control user navigation is to use conditions together with URL parameters.

![url-parameter-condition@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FcDUbJlA1zPxQdulpvNBJ%2Furl-parameter-condition%402x.png?alt=media&token=470cf6c6-4c7f-4594-a30b-2d3333981331)

[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDqAc9hj6Mc)

In the condition above we are checking the URL for a parameter called *navigation.* If the value of the parameter is *edit user* the element is visible.
 Using actions

The second way to hide and show groups is to use actions. You can choose to instantly show/hide the group by using the *Toggle an element* action, or you can apply an animation using the *Animate an element* action.

![toggle-element-bubble@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fnd0FWRYV4VAuKkTGGy3y%2Ftoggle-element-bubble%402x.png?alt=media&token=45890bd4-ef5c-4cd5-b7b0-c094cd7b0542)

The *Toggle an element* action toggles the visibility of an element.

 Repeating groups

This section covers the container type repeating group, used to display lists of things such as records from the database

The repeating group is a container type used to show a list of things such as records from the database by repeating the content of the group one time for each entry.

To show a list of things, you can also use the table element. You can read more about the table element and how it's different from a repeating group in the article below:

Article: [The table element](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers/table-elements) Article section: [The difference between repeating groups and tables](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers/table-elementthe-difference-between-repeating-groups-and-tables)​

We explored in the earlier [general section about groups](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers) that you can [load data into a group](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containerloading-data-into-groups) and allow its child elements to reference that data. Repeating groups work much in the same way, except that they are set up to work with a *list* of data rather than a single record.

For example, let's say you want to display a list of users in your app and include information like their name and email address. By adding text elements to a repeating group showing that information, the content of the group will be duplicated for as many users are in the list. If the list contains five users, every element that you add to the Repeating Group will be repeated five times.

Let's explore a few different ways in which you can use repeating groups to set up flexible lists of data in creative ways:
 List design

In the example below there are some key things to note about how repeating groups work:

- We have set the *Type of content* to User, meaning the repeating group will accept a list of users as its data source
- In the *Data Source* we are using the *Do a search for* command to load a list of users
- In the repeating group you can see that the text element inside is repeated once for each row. Each row is called a *cell*.
- We can reference the user in each cell by including *Current Cell's X* in the expression. In the example below that makes it the *Current Cell's User* since our *Type of content* is set to user. From referencing the current user, we can fetch their first name.

![repeating-group-in-editor@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FnlAbjJ4QKcVb0QZyqgRW%2Frepeating-group-in-editor%402x.png?alt=media&token=b61d74be-98b7-46f4-a3c5-42c36d28370e)

Let's see how that would look in the live app:

![repeating-group-live@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FO6sRH5FQHzKYG2ITjUgD%2Frepeating-group-live%402x.png?alt=media&token=43cbc94a-3d8d-4aae-9d98-66d9e3ec15ae)

By referencing the *Current cell's User's Name* we can display information about the relevant user loaded into each cell.
 Card design

As we saw in the previous example, repeating groups can be used to set up simple lists such as a list of contacts in a CRM or products in a product inventory system.

But they can also be used in powerful ways to set up lists that are designed in other ways such as product cards:

![product-cards@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FHhiFuyaLpL3ieQDJNRG1%2Fproduct-cards%402x.png?alt=media&token=65e8eaa3-27e0-4f68-b0d3-c2ab69197a05)

In this example we're showing a Repeating Group of two cells. Inside of those cells we're combining Regular Groups and other elements to create a design that's very different from the list we created earlier.

In the illustration above, the white card with the shadow is a [regular group](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers/groups) placed within the cell of the Repeating Group. We've styled it with a white background, rounded corners and a shadow and placed an image, a few text elements and a button to complete the design.

![product-details@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FGiUpOxLQkAyPHvbnmCn8%2Fproduct-details%402x.png?alt=media&token=307cec0f-d81a-43c2-93bf-344d8282fbf5)

Looking at the elements in the Bubble Design Editor we can see that each element references the parent Group's data – the Product. The parent Group (the one with the shadow) in turn references the current cell of the Repeating Group.

From a database perspective, the products we are looking at would include fields for Name (text), Price (number), Image (image) and Description (text) that we can then load and display for each cell of the Repeating Group.

![product-fields@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FsFU7Ts4O7WnnwurWosAa%2Fproduct-fields%402x.png?alt=media&token=ed0e337e-ad11-4362-8d7f-94e6ecdf6697)

In this example we've set up a Data Type called Product and assigned a few fields that we can then show in the Repeating Group.
 Masonry design

With Bubble's responsive engine, you can use Repeating Groups to set up a fully responsive masonry design.

![masonry-devices.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FWkfIjQrfbQmTUfawIKGX%2Fmasonry-devices.jpg?alt=media&token=f9430326-8441-4ce2-a8b5-b275799be85a)

Using the *Display items as a masonry grid* you can show the items in the Repeating Group in a dynamic size that automatically adjusts to every screen size.

Try our interactive tutorial below or scroll down for the text version.

To use the masonry design, you need to complete a few steps:

- The masonry layout requires that you use the [responsive engine](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers/repeating-groups).
- In the Property Editor for the Repeating Group, make sure you have both *Set fixed number of rows* and *Stretch rows to fill vertical space* unchecked:

![CleanShot 2023-02-08 at 14.09.51.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FXatDVxdDzvo4Xbs9m94B%2FCleanShot%202023-02-08%20at%2014.09.51.png?alt=media&token=ee9b2e41-35f6-4d8c-956c-4dd840736f88)

- Set *Scroll Direction* of the Repeating Group to *Vertical*.
- Check *Display items as masonry grid*

When the masonry grid settings have been set you can adjust the gap between each cell in pixels by changing the *Row cell gap* and *Column cell gap* settings.

 Table elements

This section covers the table element, used to display lists of things such as records from the database in a table-like structure of rows and columns

> > The Table element requires:

- > > that you are using Bubble version 21+​
- > > that the page is set to use the responsive engine​

> > To show a list of things, you can also use the repeating group element. You can read more about the repeating group element and how it's different from a table element in the article below:

> > Article: [Repeating groups](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers/repeating-groups) Article section: [The difference between repeating groups and tables](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers/table-elementthe-difference-between-repeating-groups-and-tables)​

The table element is a container type used to show a list of things, such as records from the database, by repeating the content of the group one time for each entry, similar to Repeating Groups. The two elements differ in some basic ways, and as the name suggests, the table element has specific properties that make it well suited to creating neat tables.

![table-example@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FmOIOg3rHYRoI1dlrftkm%2Ftable-example%402x.png?alt=media&token=8b46a39e-2d8f-450e-b32e-9a8abe7a4216)

The table element lets you easily set up tables with sticky column headers.

Let’s first have a look at how the repeating group and table elements are different:
 The difference between repeating groups and tables

These two element types share many characteristics and are edited in much the same way: Elements that you place inside one cell will be repeated for each record that is specified in the element’s data source.

For example, if you load a list of the User data type into any of these elements and place a text element that references the *Current Cell’s User’s email address*, then each row will show the email address of that entry in the database.

The table element offers a few additional features that make tables even easier to set up and maintain:

- You can prevent one or more static rows at the top of the table from being affected by the element’s data source. This is useful for creating column headers.
- Static rows can be made sticky, meaning that they will remain at the top as you scroll through the records below
- You can add and delete rows and columns, making it easier to make changes to the overall table structure as needed
- Rows and columns can be copy/pasted
- Tables have columns that keep content perfectly aligned within rows

Repeating groups are your best choice when you want to set up flexible displays of list information, like simple lists, card designs, or masonry grids. Table elements are faster to work with when you want to set up classic table structures with rows/columns and labels.
 Using the table element

When you draw a table element on the page, a table will be created with three columns and four rows, with the top row being static.
 Static rows/columns

The top row in the automatically generated table is a static row, meaning that it doesn’t rely on the list of data loaded into the rows below. You can have one or more static rows, and the elements placed in them will not be repeated (unlike the repeating rows and a repeating group).

As the table element works with columns in addition to rows, you can easily align the content of the static rows with that of the repeating rows. This makes it easier to design neat tables that consistently resize responsively: For example, you can place column headers in the static rows and they’ll align with the content in the repeating rows automatically.

If you configure the table to have a horizontal orientation instead of a vertical one, the rows and columns will be transposed.
 Repeating rows/columns

Repeating rows contain the data specified in the element’s Type of data and Data source fields. Just like in a repeating group, each row will repeat itself (along with its content) with one row per entry in the data source list.

This means you can only ever edit the first repeating row. Then that content will be duplicated to the rows below. You can add as many columns as you need, and each of them can contain their own elements.

If you configure the table to have a horizontal orientation instead of a vertical one, the rows and columns will be transposed.
 Selecting and managing the table element

The table element has an orientation property, which allows you to switch the axis of the rows and columns. By default, the table orientation is vertical. When the orientation is configured to horizontal, the information below is inverted, meaning that the rows and columns are transposed.

![select-table@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FWOg1FAJF5SYgx0pwa6jt%2Fselect-table%402x.png?alt=media&token=d4e86ab7-cdd9-4178-bf23-61bc61f3ff56)

Clicking the icon in the upper left corner selects the entire table.

The table element behaves a bit differently from other Bubble elements, as it allows you to select pseudo-elements that each have their own properties. When you hover over the table element, column and row handles appear to help you make the correct selection. The element itself and the pseudo-elements can be selected individually.
 General properties

You can select the whole table element by clicking the icon in the top-left corner. This opens up the property editor for the full element, where you select the type of data you want to load, the data source for the list, as well as the general settings for styling, responsive behavior, and conditions.

The table element also allows you to select multiple rows and columns to apply specific properties to more than one at a time. To select multiple rows or columns, press and hold the Shift key while clicking on the rows/columns you want to include in your selection.
 Managing rows

You can select and manage both static and repeating rows. Each static row that you add can be selected individually, but you can only select the first repeating row.

The easiest way to select a row is to click the numbered row handle. Bubble also displays your rows and columns as pseudo-elements in the element tree.

When a row is selected, you can set its:

- Background style
- Opacity
- Height controls (Min width / Max width / Fit height to content)
- Page load visibility
- Conditions
 Adding/removing rows

You can add and remove rows as needed to your table. Static and repeating rows behave a bit differently in this regard:
 Static rows

To add a static row, right-click any static row or the top repeating row and select Add row above/below. To delete one, right-click that row and select Delete from the floating menu.
 Repeating rows

Repeating rows are not added individually. Instead, they’re controlled with the properties specified in the top-most repeating row.

- Select the top repeating row by clicking the row handle. The row is marked with a ∞ symbol.
- ​
   - If the Set fixed number of repeating rows box is checked, you can specify the number of rows you want to display using the Row count setting.
   - If the Set fixed number of repeating rows box is unchecked, Bubble will load as many rows as there are entries in the list of the data source.
 Managing columns

To select a column, click its column handle (A, B, etc). From there, you can adjust the column’s properties:

- Page visibility
- Responsive behavior
- Conditions
 Adding/removing columns

You can **add** columns in two different ways:

- Right-click any column and select Add column to left/right.
- Hover your mouse over the separator between two columns, and you’ll see a floating + symbol. Clicking it will add a column on the right side.

![add-cilumn@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FAHy4VjC1VJWsEWLiDakU%2Fadd-cilumn%402x.png?alt=media&token=4d039586-c79b-4395-9475-65a2394b959f)

Hovering the mouse cursor over the line that separates two columns (marked in red) allows you to add a column between the two columns.

You can also **remove** columns in two ways:

- Rick-click any column and select Delete.
- Hover any column handle and click the X symbol hovering over the table.

Note: You cannot delete the last column.

![delete-column@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F5bTy4Vmm3mTwykWFqHTi%2Fdelete-column%402x.png?alt=media&token=00ee3659-564b-4130-b5ef-d6487d47c155)

One way to delete a column is to click the X icon hovering above the column you want to remove.
 Managing cells

Each cell has its own properties and can be assigned conditions. To select a cell, click on the cell; the property editor will display that cell’s settings.
 Working with elements

Like other Bubble container elements, table elements let you place elements in a parent-child relationship. That said, as we explored earlier, table elements are slightly different from the rest of Bubble’s containers in that they include pseudo-child containers for the rows, columns, and cells that you create.
 Navigating the pseudo-groups

The easiest way to navigate through the different cells in your table’s static and repeating rows is to click them directly. The pseudo-groups can also be explored using the element tree on the left-hand side of the editor. They are displayed in the hierarchy of parent and child containers, with the top parent being the table element itself. You will find all your static rows just below the table element, and your repeating rows will appear after that.

![navigate-pseudo-elements@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FLVFmFRvO8H27OvR51V8x%2Fnavigate-pseudo-elements%402x.png?alt=media&token=5e4611cf-8ef8-4eef-8aa2-508a3951864e)

When you set up a table, its pseudo-groups become visible and selectable in the element tree.

Keep in mind that you can make any edits you want to the static rows, whereas with repeating rows, you can only edit the first one; the content within that row will be duplicated for all rows below.
 Responsive behavior

When working with responsive behavior for the table element, it helps to think of the parent element (the table itself) and each row and column as separate containers that can have their own responsive settings.
 Total width and height

The total width and height of the entire table container is set on the parent element (the table element itself). In turn, the width and height of the container control the maximum width and height of the table’s individual rows and columns, unless the table container is set to fit width/height to content, with no maximum value.
 Column width

The column width is set at an individual column level. Select the column by clicking its handle or selecting it in the element tree, and then make any needed changes in the property editor. The width of the column will be the same for all rows, including both static and repeating rows.
 Row height

The row height is set at an individual row level. For repeating rows, the height properties are set on the first (top) row.
 Container layout

Just like a regular group, each cell can have its own individual container layout (fixed, row, column, and align to parent) that controls the behavior of its child elements. For cells in static rows, you can control each individual cell, while cells in a repeating row are controlled by each individual cell in the first (top) row.

 Popups

This section covers the container type Popup, which is a group that hovers above all other elements on the screen

[](https://youtu.be/YXxYeHlowWk)

The *Popup* group type is a a group that is displayed above all other elements and is centered on the screen regardless of the scrolling position of the page. They can be set up to hide or blur the page below. As such, they are a useful way to bring an important message or forms to the user's attention immediately.

Typical use cases for popups include:

- Error messages and alerts
- Registration forms
- Contact/Feedback forms
- Newsletter Signup forms
- Promotional offers and discounts

![popup.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F7njiZCTBd0ijps3pWiYO%2Fpopup.jpg?alt=media&token=7b1109d8-13eb-4ae1-b39d-c42ba5b0418c)

Popups can be used to bring attention to your users immediately. In this example we're encouraging users to complete their profile.
 Showing and hiding popups

Popups are never visible by default and cannot be displayed using conditions. In this way they are a bit different from other groups.

Popups are displayed using one of two actions:

- You can use the *Show an element* action to show the popup. Bubble automatically applies a slight fade animation to the group when it's displayed and hidden
- Your second option is to use the *Animate an element* action to pick what kind of animation you want to use to display the popup

![show-popup-action@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FWu3HhUTp2RSXQAvhhFD9%2Fshow-popup-action%402x.png?alt=media&token=db89d6b0-9a42-40c7-96b0-bc4ed4261550)

Using the *Show an element* action the popup will automatically fade in.
 Custom events for popups

A workflow consists of an *even* and a set of *actions*. The event is used to determine when the collection of actions should run.

![workflow-schema.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FixsfXqyGYp0EYeqkGX3u%2Fworkflow-schema.jpeg?alt=media&token=31eb1a55-017c-44c0-bcca-c09cf4608c44)

Adding a popup to a page gives you two more events that you can use to trigger a workflow:

![popup-opened-or-closed@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FwBZvfX7Qu5hUH16XEU30%2Fpopup-opened-or-closed%402x.png?alt=media&token=3a644742-9550-4feb-87e4-e2a75deaa27b)

Popups give you access to two new events that trigger whenever the popup is opened or closed.

- **A popup is closed** will trigger every time a specific popup is closed using the *Hide an element* or *Animate an element* actions
- **A popup is opened** will trigger every time a specific popup is closed using the *Show an element* or *Animate an element* actions

The events will trigger every time the popups is opened or closed (as opposed to just the first time). A typical scenario where an event like this is useful is to reset the content of the popup after it's closed.
 Popups and security

While popups can be set up to cover the content of the page with a specific color or a blur filter, it should not be considered a secure way to hide sensitive information. A popup can be hidden by a tech-savvy user, revealing the content below.

 Floating groups

This section covers the group type Floating Group, which is used primarily for attaching a group to one of the sides of the screen, regardless of scrolling position

Floating Groups are a group type that can be set up to hover above other elements on the page and they can be attached to any side of the screen and stay there regardless of whether the user scrolls up and down.

Some typical use cases for floating groups include:

- Navigation menus: A floating menu bar that stays at the top of the screen while users scroll down the page.
- Social media icons: Floating icons that stay in a fixed position, usually in the corner of the screen, and provide quick access to social media profiles.
- Chatbots: A chat widget that pops up in a floating window, allowing users to communicate with a customer support agent or AI chatbot.
- Shopping carts: A floating cart that displays items a user has added to their shopping cart and allows them to checkout from anywhere on the site.
- Back-to-top buttons: A floating button that appears when a user scrolls down the page, allowing them to quickly return to the top of the page.

![floating-group.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FfAqVyRnKJo4Qg0D5vf3o%2Ffloating-group.jpeg?alt=media&token=fdace2d0-5e38-4baf-b42d-53da3ec0727f)

A typical use case for Floating Groups is to set up a navigation header that sticks to the top of the screen. The example above is from Bubble's homepage – which is built using Bubble.
 Sticking Floating Groups to the screen edge

Floating Groups can be set up to stay along the edge of the screen even if the user scrolls. It can follow the screen edge exactly or be place at a given distance using margins.

To set a Floating Group to stick to the edge, you need to pick a vertical and horizontal axis for the group to stay floating relevant to. You do this by opening up the Property Editor for the group and changing the following setting:

![floating-group@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FgTEYWskrAj6kpJ6aN7yw%2Ffloating-group%402x.png?alt=media&token=e1098f98-a3c7-47bd-a75d-16ef5119c777)

The two top settings in the Property Editor of the Floating Group allows you to have the group float relative to both the vertical and horizontal axis.
 What is the z-index?

The z-index allows you to choose whether the Floating Group should float above or below the other elements, including the page itself.

> > Note that if you change the setting below to *Beneath the page*, the group will literally be beneath the page itself (and not just beneath the elements on the page). As a result, if the page has a background style, it may block the Floating Group from sight.

 Group focus

This section covers the group type Group Focus. This group will remain visible for as long as it is in focus, typically used for dropdown menus

[](https://youtu.be/l_SbovrRt2s)

The Group Focus has two main characteristics:

- It will remain visible only for as long as it is in focus. *Focus* in this context means until you click anywhere else on the page.
- They are displayed relative to another element by a set number of pixels

These features gives it several typical use cases:

- Contextual menus
- Floating Action Buttons
- Dropdown Menus
- Tooltips

​

[https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FegnHsmqcvjpea5mIeVf6%2Fgroup-focus-dropdown-menu-trimmed.webp?alt=media&token=c64614bf-ec61-44e3-9daf-8df4376c2dc2](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FegnHsmqcvjpea5mIeVf6%2Fgroup-focus-dropdown-menu-trimmed.webp?alt=media&token=c64614bf-ec61-44e3-9daf-8df4376c2dc2)

Group Focus is useful for setting up dropdown menus

In the example above you can see a typical use case for the group focus. The white rectangle with the shadow is the Group Focus, and we are using the *Animate an element* action when the icon is clicked to give it a smooth transition. As soon as a click happens outside of the Group Focus it's automatically hidden without any actions needed.

![group-focus-settings@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F0ugZtxq74FTWUe1rmQQZ%2Fgroup-focus-settings%402x.png?alt=media&token=6152a07d-3f64-41b2-9b7d-e90ff4293ccb)

Taking a look in the Bubble editor, we can note a few things:

- The *Reference element* is set to the icon. This means that the Group Focus will be displayed relative to the icon.
- We have given it an offset of -150 pixels to push it to the left side of the icon. This is simply an aesthetic choice
- When the icon is clicked, the *Animate an element* action displays. Notice that no action is needed to hide it again.

![animate-group-focus@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FPZzWeVVbe8dXlt4PSLWI%2Fanimate-group-focus%402x.png?alt=media&token=d0a1f65e-bd18-459a-999f-60c19bc8b870)

We chose the SlideDownIn animation to display the dropdown menu, and give it a slightly shorter duration than the default. Both of these options are also purely aesthetic.
 Using Group Focus in Repeating Groups

​[Repeating Groups](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers/repeating-groups) behave a bit differently than other group types because the contain *multiple* *cells*. As a consequence, you can't directly reference an element inside of a Repeating Group cell, since Bubble can't know which cell you are trying to reference.

This creates a challenge when using the Group Focus, because it depends on being able to reference another element to know where to display it. There's a way to get around this however: if you place the Group Focus and the element it should reference inside of a Reusable Element, and then place that Reusable Element inside of the Repeating Group, it will work.

This is useful in scenarios where you want to place a contextual menu in a Repeating Group.

![repeating-group-group-focus@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F8NK0rfoZ18do2IrtOTSh%2Frepeating-group-group-focus%402x.png?alt=media&token=9b4477ca-bdd0-4871-aa87-df39f6e6495a)

In the example above, both the clickable icon *and* the Group Focus is contained within a Reusable Element. This Reusable Element is then duplicated for each cell of the Repeating Group. To make sure that we can apply actions to the dropdown menu that are relevant to the user in the current row, make sure to set the Reusable Element's *Type of content* to User:

![dropdown-reusable-element@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FGSFMwLwEBft3kqkbN1W6%2Fdropdown-reusable-element%402x.png?alt=media&token=20a75777-d382-4f66-b58f-9088be35ca63)

This setting is set when you edit the Reusable Element and open the Property Editor for the Reusable Element itself.

Then, when selecting the Reusable Element you have placed in the Repeating Group, you set the Data Source to the *Current Cell's User*:

![reference-current-cell@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F7Uc1oMvQuWmte2trmWZS%2Freference-current-cell%402x.png?alt=media&token=da1e9933-7510-4402-a2ad-c6059e19cf3f)

By setting the Data Source of the Reusable Element to the content of the current cell, we are passing data from that specific cell into the Reusable Element, where you can bind it to actions in the dropdown menu.

 Visual elements

This section describes the visual elements that are available in the Bubble editor

**Visual elements** are the elements you can place on that page that cannot contain other elements (groups) and cannot accept input (input elements). They usually serve two purposes:

- To display information or contribute to the aesthetics of the page
- To accept button clicks

![visual-elements.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FfCVBcIx6nsfvTYNik6qK%2Fvisual-elements.jpg?alt=media&token=30e87bad-eead-40bc-821d-ec07e574b8ed)

In the illustration above, all elements are visual elements: text, an image and a button.

The visual elements category contains the following elements:
 Text

A non-editable text element. Both the header and the body copy in the image above are text elements.

 Input forms

This section covers Input forms. These are element that accept data input from a user such as text, numbers, dates, uploads and dynamic content.

Input forms are the elements that you use to collect information from your users. They can be used for a simple checkbox or combined into complex forms.

> > The articles in this section cover Bubble's built-in input elements. There are also a wide range of plugins in the [plugin store](https://bubble.io/plugins) that offer new ways of accepting user input.
 Different kinds of input

User input can mean many things, and most applications accept a wide range of different categories of input from their users. Even single forms are usually made up of different types of inputs that makes it easy for your users to understand what kind of data they're asked to provide.

​

![input-fields.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FjxED1orHEKtyKGSKZHcM%2Finput-fields.jpg?alt=media&token=df0bc4ca-1c3f-47a0-80a7-de2ce2064b88)

A simple signup form like the one above combines several different categories of input forms to make the UX easy for your users to understand and to prepare the data for processing – such as saving it in the database.

​
 Text and numbers

Text and number inputs allow users to provide text ranging from short, structured data like an email address, an order number or a name to long, unstructured data like a blog post or product description. Text can be formatted (rich text) or unformatted (plain text).

Article: [Text and number elements](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/input-forms/text-and-numbers)​
 Dates and time

Date and time inputs allow users to provide date and time values. Some inputs let users type the information in, others are set up to let users pick a date from a calendar and a time from a timepicker.

Article: [Dates and time elements](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/input-forms/dates-and-time)​
 File uploads

File uploads are a third category of input that allows users to upload any kind of file to your application.

Article: [File uploads](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/input-forms/file-uploads)​
 Selection controls

Selection controls are input elements that let you set up pre-defined options for your users to select from. This allows you to restrict the available choices, ranging from simple yes/no answers to selecting preset text/numerical values and dynamic content from your app's database.

This includes:

- Checkboxes
- Radio buttons
- Dropdown lists

Article: [Selection control](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/input-forms/selection-controls)​
 Triggering a workflow when an input is changed

You can trigger a workflow whenever the value of a specific input form is changed.

----
 Text and numbers

This section covers elements that accept text and numbers as user input

Text and number inputs allow your users to provide their own text strings and numbers to your application that can then be saved in the database or used in other ways.

There are a few different elements that are useful in various scenarios, and those elements can be set up to handle different kinds of formatting and user experiences.
 Input elements

> > This is the user manual article on the Input Element which gives an overview of how the element works. If you want the technical reference that describes all the settings for this element, check out the Reference entry:

> > Reference: [Input Element](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/input-forminput)​

Input elements are used for single-line plaintext, but they allow you to specify a content format from a wide range of different options. The *Field type returned* in the list below specifies what kind of database field format the input will return.

> **How Bubble stores text formatting**

> Bubble uses a markup language called BBCode to store text formatting such as bold, italitcs, bullet points etc. The BBCode is generated and applied automatically as you add formatting to your text.

> BBCode is simpler and safer to use than HTML and because it has more limited capabilities, and only allows for a select number of tags. This stops your users from being able to upload any malicious code such as CSS or Javascript that might break the app.

> External link: [Guide to BBCode](https://www.bbcode.org/how-to-use-bbcode-a-complete-guide.php) External link: [BBCode tags reference](https://www.bbcode.org/reference.php)​

> I want to use HTML instead

> Sometimes it's useful to be able to store formatted text as HTML, such as when you want to pass formatted text to an email sending service that ony supports this format.

> None of the built-in Bubble text editors supports HTML formatting, but there are multiple [plugins](https://bubble.io/plugins) that allow you to store text with formatting as HTML instead of BBCode. Searching the plugin store for *Rich Text Editor* is likely to give you some results that support this.

> Regular text elements don't support HTML either: if you want to display text formatted with HTML you can use the built-in HTML element.

> > Because of the predictive text functionality on **Android devices**, some content formats involving masks have a slightly different UX. This applies to US Phone, Percentage, Currency, Date, Euro date, and Text (numbers only).

> > On Android devices, the input allows users to type anything and validates the content against the mask only after the user stops typing.

> > This does not affect the final data generated by the input.
 **Text**

The input will accept any text value.

**Field type returned:** text

![text@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FInTKZvMONIQxfPSKSVpW%2Ftext%402x.png?alt=media&token=421be641-2d5b-4675-8710-f37d7126f98f)

 Password

The input will accept any kind of text value, but the characters written will be replaced by asterisks.

**Field type returned**: text

![password@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F3aRIcciAsCuViegIu7Mi%2Fpassword%402x.png?alt=media&token=26edd9a2-888d-4c08-ba93-fcf560578656)
 Integer

The input will only accept any whole number. Use this when you need to collect numerical values that can later be used for calculations (as opposed to numbers saved as text). You can specify a dynamic minimum and maximum value when this option is selected.

**Field type returned:** number

![number@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fe6jK5JD1ni2VzvNUApcl%2Fnumber%402x.png?alt=media&token=1214cbe9-2562-461f-ad53-ab361c18cbc1)
 Decimal

The input will accept any whole number or decimal number. You can specify a minimum and maximum value, as well as the number of decimals to include. You can also set the input to automatically include thousands separators as the user types. This setting is only aesthetic and does not affect the final value.

**Field type returned:** number

![decimal@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F4NeDo1RfcLxUFFCePerI%2Fdecimal%402x.png?alt=media&token=8e5338a9-2ca0-4f0e-8d67-a869657202b1)
 Address

A geographic address. With this option, the input automatically validates the address with Google Maps. Note that the input does not automatically search for valid addresses as the user types, so the user has to provide an already valid address (by copy/pasting directly from Google Maps for example). If you want the user to be able to see Google Maps search results as they type you may want to look into using the Search box element instead.

**Field type returned:** address

![address@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FGVivkTJGssfNGhQvNdmM%2Faddress%402x.png?alt=media&token=7c40eb55-aef2-49b7-befb-249163d87341)

​
 US phone

This input will accept correctly formatted US phone numbers. The value is saved as a text.

![us-phone@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FAgqbtzv0TVN3bV0iOYQN%2Fus-phone%402x.png?alt=media&token=227727f9-a957-48a5-8fb7-0598b022db89)

**Field type returned:** text
 Percentage

This input will format the user's input as a percentage and accept input such as 20%. Bubble will automatically save it in the correct numerical equivalent of the provided percentage point. For example, 20% will be saved as the number 0.2 and 150% will be saved as 1.5.

![percentage@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FvfMAM9iJsLqOwF51OjI1%2Fpercentage%402x.png?alt=media&token=35a01748-e0d2-441d-95cb-6f577548dd75)

**Field type returned:** number
 Currency

The input will accept any whole number or decimal number and it will automatically format the input in the chosen currency, such as *$20*. You can specify a minimum and maximum value, as well as the number of decimals to include. You can also set the input to automatically include thousands separators as the user types. The currency and thousands separators settings are only aesthetic and do not affect the final value.

![currency@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FyztzWebFtLYcJztKMC3q%2Fcurrency%402x.png?alt=media&token=05c2ba6c-b6c7-4eb7-9640-c5619da9ec36)

**Field type returned:** number
 Date

The input will accept any date, but does not include time. It automatically formats the input's value as mm/dd/yyyy while the user types, guiding the user to provide the date in the right way. You can specify a given time zone for the input and Bubble will automatically calculate any offset from the user's current time zone. If no time zone is provided, the user's current time zone will be used. Dates are saved at 12 am (00:00) on the given date.

![us-date@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FJAGmtVIWYWJ0e6pB8Aly%2Fus-date%402x.png?alt=media&token=95a6439b-1be4-4594-97a5-9da57d79e6d0)

Field type returned: date
 Euro date

The input will accept any date, but does not include time. It automatically formats the input's value as dd/mm/yyyy while the user types, guiding the user to provide the date in the right way. You can specify a given time zone for the input and Bubble will automatically calculate any offset from the user's current time zone. If no time zone is provided, the user's current time zone will be used. Dates are saved at 12 am (00:00) on the given date. The difference between this content format and the *Date* format is purely visual.

![euro-date@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F0BmnRHhScazb0dMZYlRI%2Feuro-date%402x.png?alt=media&token=72150c54-01c9-497c-8722-e98f7f877616)

**Field type returned:** date
 Text (numbers only)

This input will only accept whole numbers and the result will be saved as text. This is useful when you want to save numerical values that need to remain exactly as the user typed (without losing leading zero's for example) and will not be used for any type of calculation, such as international phone numbers, zip codes and order numbers.

![number@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fe6jK5JD1ni2VzvNUApcl%2Fnumber%402x.png?alt=media&token=1214cbe9-2562-461f-ad53-ab361c18cbc1)

**Field type returned:** text

Storing numbers as text versus storing them as numbers

What is the difference between the two?

The Bubble database offers two different field types that can both be used to save numerical values: text and number.

Why would you ever want to save a number as a text string? There are a few scenarios where it makes sense to do so:

**When you need to include leading zero's**

In an integer (or number) a leading zero represents no value and is disregarded when saved to the database. After all 045 and 45 are the same thing from a mathematical point of view and the zero only adds confusion and increases the total size of the database.

Sometimes leading zero's are necessary: for example a phone number or zip code might start with a zero and they must be stored as text to preserve the complete value.

When you need to pass the data as text

Sometimes when you communicate with an external system through an API, that system may expect a numerical value to be passed as text. In that case it can be useful to store it as text in the database so as to avoid having to convert it later.

​

When to use what

**Text** should be used when you are working with numerical values that will remain static and will not be included in any kinds of calculations. For example:

- Phone numbers
- Zip codes
- Postal codes
- Product/Part numbers

**Numbers** should be used when you are working with values that may need to be calculated or aggregated, such as:

- Year of birth
- Age
- Counts and totals (such as the item cart and total value of a cart)
- Financial numbers
- Enumerated values, such as the values used to represent the days of the week (e.g. Sunday = 0, Monday = 1, etc.)

​
 Multiline input

As the name suggests, the Multiline input element allows you to set up a text input element that allows for multiple lines of text. Like the regular text input, this element supports plaintext only, and does not provide any custom formatting.

![multiline-input@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FUDrMISeQa5egr2vOohbB%2Fmultiline-input%402x.png?alt=media&token=055a0a9d-b10c-4635-b880-d6a7dec1c5a7)

Use the Multiline input element when you need the user to be able to supply multiple lines of text but you don't want them to be able to add formatting such as bold, italic and headers.

**Field type returned:** text

​
 Rich Text Editor

The Rich Text Editor is a plugin. It's made by Bubble but it needs to be installed in your app before you can use it. Plugin link: [Rich text Editor](https://bubble.io/plugin/rich-text-editor-1580238841425x582072028873097200)​

The Rich Text Editor is another multiline input element that allows users to type a rich formatted text with formatting such as colors, fonts, bullet points and links.

![rich-text-editor-bubble@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FREPyaEdYlHl77vIdrdQg%2Frich-text-editor-bubble%402x.png?alt=media&token=a30f8db4-e0b4-4c6f-8a0c-86e824ba23c3)

The Rich Text Editor plugin lets your users add advanced formatting to their text.
 Hidden toolbar

The Rich Text Editor element comes with a setting to give it a more minimalistic design where the toolbar is only visible when you select some text:

![rich-text-editor-tooltip@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FmMx4SwjPPu3fj4BqNKt7%2Frich-text-editor-tooltip%402x.png?alt=media&token=487d4740-fc23-4483-bad5-6c7f26a4157f)

You can also choose to show fewer format settings than the ones above. The screenshot shows the full suite of available options.

 Dates and time

This section covers elements that accepts dates and time as user input

Date and time elements allow your users to specify a date, a time or both in different ways. Whether you want to save a user's birthday, filter search results or accept bookings in a specific time zone, Bubble offers multiple tools to set it up in a user-friendly way.

> > Designing a UX that handles dates and time opens up for a wide range of different scenarios. While Bubble's built-in tools provide a variety of features, there are also a lot of plugins that offer even more customization. Check out our [plugin store](https://bubble.io/plugins) to learn more.

> **How Bubble handles dates and time**

> Before starting to work with dates and time in Bubble, it's useful to know the basic facts about how this data is handled by Bubble.

> **How dates and time is saved**

> When you look at a date and time in Bubble, it's formatted in an easily readable format such as

- > 01/31/2050 - 01:00 pm
- > 31/1/2050 - 13:00

> In your app's database on the other hand, dates and times are saved in a different way. They are stored in a format called **Unix time** (sometimes called epoch time).

> The time in the example above would be stored like this if you are in New York City:

- > 2527264800

> Unix time is a way for computers store dates and times as a numerical value. Instead of storing it as human-readable strings (like in the upper examples), Unix time represents them as the **number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC**.

> This is not a Bubble-specific design choice, but is used across most computer systems, making it a universally recognized standard to store and exchange date and time information.

> The advantage of using Unix time is that it allows a computer to perform simple arithmetic operations with dates and times, such as comparing or sorting them, because they are represented as a single numerical value.

> Additionally, Unix time is independent of any specific time zone or calendar, making it an absolute value. The time above is 2527264800 wherever you are in the world, but the humanly-readable format of 01/31/2050 - 01:00 pm would change depending on which time zone you are in.

> Two more points arise as a natural consequence of this design:

> **Both a date and a time is always saved**

> Since all dates and times are stored as a numerical value representing seconds, it follows that this value never represents *only* a date or *only* a time: both are always saved. Whenever you save *just* a date in Bubble, it saves that date at 12 am (00:00) on that date in the provided time zone.

> **You are not saving a time zone**

> Whenever you provide a date and time to store in the Bubble database, you are not storing a time zone along with it. Keep in mind: time zones are not actual values – they are just the *formatting* of a unix time value into a readable text that matches the requested time zone. Still, that doesn't mean you don't need to take time zones into account.

> Let's look at an example to illustrate:

- > A user in New York saves the datetime 01/31/2050 - 01:00 pm The offset from UTC is -05:00 or -18000 seconds
- > A user in Sydney saves the same datetime 01/31/2050 - 01:00 pm The offset from UTC is +11:00 or 39600 seconds

> As the example shows, while they are providing the same date and time respective to their local time zone, Australia time is 16:00 hours ahead of New York.

> The lesson from this is that Bubble doesn't actually *save* the time zone, but the logic above would lead Bubble to store two different Unix time values:

- In New York (IST) the Unix time is 2527264800 seconds
- In Sydney (AEST), the Unix time is 2527207200 seconds.

Knowing the the time difference is 16 hours, the two unix time numbers should be 57600 seconds apart – which they are.

**How do I keep track of this complex system?**

In most regards, you don't need to. Time and dates are complicated to work with because of time zones, leap years, Daylight Savings Time and other inconsistensies, but Bubble takes care of all of these calculations for you.

The purpose of this infobox is to give a general understanding of how time and dates are stored and processed as this can make it easier to use Bubble's tools efficiently.

**A caution when importing datetime data**

Dates are stored in the Bubble database in an epoch or UNIX time format.

This format looks at the number of seconds that have elapsed since midnight UTC on Jan 1, 1970, which can result in some inconsistency when dealing with dates that are very far in the past or in the future from 1970. Owing to the instability of the epoch time format in handling dates significantly distant from the epoch, there can be an irregular offset associated with the date.

As a result, importing and re-exporting (or vice versa) these types of dates can result in slightly offset values.

At present, the only alternative to bypass this issue is to store dates as "text" fields. However, we are actively exploring potential enhancements to time zone handling, which could alleviate this issue in the future.
 Date/time picker

[](https://youtu.be/Vhk1qcqL4Z8)

The date/time picker lets your users pick a date and a time from a visual calendar. It can also be set up to only pick a date, in which case the field to the right in the animation below will be hidden.

![calendar-demo.webp](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fui3nAPAvO8e0oM0XTmFh%2Fcalendar-demo.webp?alt=media&token=8ad4b2cd-9983-4516-b772-9ba82a08461f)

The date/time picker gives your users a visual interface to pick a date or both.

If you set up the element to only ask for a date, the date will be saved at 12 am (00:00) on the chosen date in the current user's time zone. If you have selected a different time zone in the Property Editor, the date will be saved at 12 am (00:00) in that time zone.

You can set a minimum and maximum date as well as a minimum and maximum time of day, and you can set the interval for the time picker (which is 30 minutes by default).

**Field type returned:** date

 Input element

The input element is mainly used for text input, but can be set up to expect a date instead. In this case the user will not see a calendar or time picker, but will instead be able to type the date directly. Note that the input element supports dates but not time. It can be set up to format the date in:

- US format (mm/dd/yyyy)
- European format (dd/mm/yyyy)

![us-date@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FJAGmtVIWYWJ0e6pB8Aly%2Fus-date%402x.png?alt=media&token=95a6439b-1be4-4594-97a5-9da57d79e6d0)

 File uploads

This section covers elements that lets your users upload files and images

File upload elements let your users upload any kind of file to the Bubble server. Bubble has two different elements for uploading files: one for general file uploads and one specifically for images.

> **File storage and the database**

> In the Bubble Data Type editor you can add two types of file upload fields:

- > file
- > image

> When you upload a file to the Bubble database, the database doesn't actually store the file itself. The process is actually two-fold: first, Bubble uploads the file to the AWS server and then it saves the URL to the file in the database.

> In other words, both the *file* and *image* fields in the database only contain a URL *pointing* to a file, and not the file itself. From a performance perspective, this means that your database only holds a short text value (the file's URL), and the file is not downloaded until it's needed.

> **Deleting uploaded files**

> As we explored in the infobox above about [File storage and the database](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/input-forms/file-uploadfile-storage-and-the-database), the database doesn't actually store the file – only the URL to the file.

> As a consequence, if you delete the content of the *image* field in the database, it will remove the URL, but the file itself is not deleted.

> To actually delete the file from the server, you need to use the *Delete an uploaded file* action in a workflow. Keep in mind that you need the URL of the file to delete; as such you should delete the file *before* you clear the URL from the database. Video tutorial: [Deleting uploaded files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z6b2UH_JAw)​

> > Uploaded files are public by default, meaning that anyone with the URL can access it. If you want your files to be securely private, you need to check the *Make this file private* on the uploader element and set up your Privacy Rules correctly. This applies both to images and other files. You can read more about these settings in the core reference articles below:

> > Reference: [Uploading files to be private](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/input-formmake-this-file-private)

> > Reference: [Protecting uploaded files with Privacy Rules](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/privacview-attached-files)

> > Video tutorial: [Setting up Privacy Rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-meIeBUXPY)​
 File uploader

[](https://youtu.be/2wQo0Nve4Zs)

The File uploader element is used for uploading non-image files. It also supports uploading image file types, but the Image uploader element offers some additional features for that.

![file-uploader@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FUKXIlzNjH01wD1TbDM4a%2Ffile-uploader%402x.png?alt=media&token=9e89cf2b-8c4c-4d85-abdb-f663ec2231f8)

The File uploader element will show the filename after the user has selected a file to upload.

You can set a maximum size for the uploaded file. The File uploader element introduces a new action that lets you cancel an ongoing upload.
 Image uploader

[](https://youtu.be/ZXjhQkM5qV0)

The Image uploader element is used for uploading images and will give you a preview of the image after the upload. If you have set an image as its initial content it will also show that image, making it useful for images that are sometimes updated, like profile pics.

![profile-picture@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FvmgNYBP1D2J3PUZtDk1C%2Fprofile-picture%402x.png?alt=media&token=c7e27ffa-daf4-45e3-9dab-f39c557cc7f8)

The Image uploader element will show the image after it has been uploaded. In the example above we have styled the element to be circular.

​

Multi-FileUploader (with drop area)

The Multi-FileUploader is similar to the regular file Uploader, but with two key differences:

- It allows uploading multiple files
- It allows you to set up a drop area where your users can drag-and-drop files

![multi-fileuploader.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FX3qkkGGorybvNl2PRXyx%2Fmulti-fileuploader.png?alt=media&token=3a965e18-87b1-45ac-bc76-f3ecec502010)

It allows you to set a maximum number of files to upload and an initial list of files to display upon page load.

> > The Multi-FileUploader element is a plugin. It's made by Bubble but it needs to be installed in your app before you can use it. Search for Multi-FileUploader in the plugin store to install it.

 Selection controls

This section covers selection control elements, that lets you set up input elements with predefined options

Selection control elements are input elements that let your users make a choice from a preselected set of options. This ranges from a simple *yes/no* answer to picking one or more records from the database or other data sources.
 Checkbox

[](https://youtu.be/HnJPoIAXgRc)

The Checkbox element is the most basic selection control element which simply returns a yes or a no depending on whether the box is checked or not.

![checkbox@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FCvj609VUxZsynHnpmhtx%2Fcheckbox%402x.png?alt=media&token=b7fecc1b-d349-45d7-89ac-9fb6474d6b3b)

 Radio button

[](https://youtu.be/jqj5LnkjWNs)

The Radio button element is similar to the checkbox, but allows you to add more than one option. You can set up a static list of text options (in the example below we have used the texts Option 1, Option 2 and Option 3) or you can fetch a list of Things from the database and display one of their fields as the label.

![radio-button@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FiAmRTJNDaXk6f37MMNRM%2Fradio-button%402x.png?alt=media&token=39573ba2-a3cf-4161-aa99-e5a8b38b54df)

 Dropdown

[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jdnZtSBbjA)

The Dropdown element, similarly to the Radio button element lets you give your users one choice out of a selection of texts or from the database.

![dropdown@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FuOTcE8kMawE5aV27UHda%2Fdropdown%402x.png?alt=media&token=6ee8b8f3-7694-4f9f-bbe8-ce739cfc7926)

 Searchbox element

[](https://youtu.be/TYlb77ObEyg)

The search box element lets you set up a flexible text search for database records. The element looks like a regular [input field](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/input-forms/text-and-numberinput-elements) but quickly and dynamically returns search results as the user types.

![searchbox@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FoZjfzyTNgSQkvdPtZ0np%2Fsearchbox%402x.png?alt=media&token=00304fce-eb9e-4d84-9767-acef2d2c27fb)

> > **Note:** Each time you type or change a character in the search box element, it triggers a fresh database query. While this ensures a rapid search response, it's worth remembering that each query consumes some workload. To learn more about workload management, refer to our article series linked below.

 Reusable Elements

This section covers reusable elements: elements that can be using in multiple places in your app

Reusable elements are a way to create groups of elements that can be used in more than one place.

For example, if you have created a navigation toolbar, you may want that same toolbar to be visible on multiple pages, and only have to make changes to it once to update all of them.

![laptop-bubble-website-header.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FRiQEjJaPj60kZqzLYO0u%2Flaptop-bubble-website-header.png?alt=media&token=52943c82-38d2-4e90-834d-ae8607513470)

The navigation toolbar on [www.bubble.io](http://www.bubble.io) (marked in red) is a typical use case for reusable elements. This toolbar and all its buttons and workflows can be re-used in as many places as you need.

Reusable elements contain elements, workflows and custom states and each instance of the reusable element behaves in isolation: in other words, what happens in one reusable element has no effect on other copies of the same reusable element, even if they're on the same page.
 Examples of reusable elements

Reusable elements can be used for any collection of elements/workflows that you want to re-use across your app. To further illustrate what reusable elements are often used for, let's look at a few examples:

- **Navigation Bar**: This is usually placed at the top of every page and provides links to the main sections of your app.
- **Footer**: Like the navigation bar, a footer is a consistent element placed at the bottom of each page, containing information such as copyright notices, contact details, and additional links.
- **Login/Signup Form**: forms reused across different pages for user authentication.
- **Search Bar**: If your app includes a search function, you may want that feature to be present on multiple pages.
- **Buttons**: Call to action (CTA) buttons like "Sign Up", "Buy Now", or "Learn More" can be standardized and used throughout your application.
- **Sidebar Menu**: a sidebar menu may be present on multiple pages for navigation.
- **Pop-up Modals**: Reusable pop-up windows for things like confirmation messages or user prompts.
- **Contact Forms**: Standardized forms for user inquiries.
- **Data Cards**: Card lists showing stuff like user profiles, eCommerce products and tourist destinations
- **Error Messages**: Standardized error messages can be used across different scenarios and pages.
 Why use reusable elements?

There are many reasons as to why you would want to use them:
 Speeding up development and maintenance

Any change that you make to a reusable element is instantly visible across all instances of it. Instead of making changes in a lot of different places across your app, you can centralize the management of key features into one element.
 Maintaining consistency

By using reusable elements for designs that are used frequently, like forms, pop-ups, and footers, you give your app a consistent look and cut down on the work you have to do to maintain it.
 Isolating work in the Bubble editor

If a page has lots of elements and workflows, putting some parts in reusable elements can make it easier to focus. This way, there are fewer things to keep track of on the screen at the same time.
 Performance

Reusable elements keep your app lightweight and performant, since its content only needs to be loaded once.
 Reusing workflows

Reusable elements can also be used to store workflows that you use in multiple places across your app. In fact, a reusable element doesn't have to contain any visible elements – you can use it to simply trigger workflows.
 Reusable element types

Reusable elements can be created as one of the following container types:

- **Group:** used to contain other elements
- **Popup:** used to contain other elements and hover centered above all other content on the page
- **Floating group**: used to contain other elements and hover near an edge of the screen (such as a navigation toolbar)

> > Each of these types behave in the same way that their container element counterparts do. You can read more about the different types in our article series on containers.

> > Article series: [Containers](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers)​
 Creating reusable elements

There are multiple ways to create new reusable elements:
 The page menu

To create a new blank reusable element:

- Open the page navigation menu in the upper left corner of the Bubble editor
- Scroll to the *Reusable elements* section
- Click *Add a new reusable element*

![create-reusable-element@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FoaImHSXtWkfoozIbbviR%2Fcreate-reusable-element%402x.png?alt=media&token=3ff4bf68-9b81-4b6a-986c-53bed0b5ace7)
 The element tree

You can also create a blank reusable element using the element tree:

- Navigate to the *Design* tab of the Bubble editor
- In the element tree, scroll down to the *Reusable elements* section
- Click *New reusable*

![element-tree-reusable-element@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FNM8wnNYL0R8sIHMzAJft%2Felement-tree-reusable-element%402x.png?alt=media&token=95255d23-ae64-4124-9d0b-f3b5a8566c02)
 Converting existing element(s)

You can also convert one or more elements on a page into a reusable element:

- If you select a container element, a new reusable element will be created, containing the child elements inside of the original container
- If you select one or more elements, a new reusable element will be created containing those elements
- The original elements on the page will not be deleted or replaced with the newly created reusable element
- Any workflows associated with the selected elements will be copied into the new reusable element, but may break if they lose access to original references

To convert existing containers or elements into a reusable, do the following:

- Select one or more elements on the page
- Right-click the mouse on one of the selected elements or click the *Edit* menu at the top of the screen
- Select *Convert to a reusable element*

A new reusable element will be created and you will be taken to that element in the editor.

Our Academy course includes how to convert groups into reusable elements
 Passing data to and from a reusable element

In many cases you'll need to pass data to and from a reusable element. There are a few different ways to do this:
 Using the data source

When a reusable element has a *Type of content* set and it's been placed on the page, you can set a data source for it. For example, if the reusable element has a data type called *Product* as its type of content, you can set any product in your database as the data source on the page where the reusable element is placed.

This method works **one** direction: passing data from the parent to the reusable element.
 The Display data action

The *Display data* action can be used to send any kind of data to the reusable element, as long as it matches the *Type of content* set on that element. For example, if you have a form to edit someone's user profile, you can send the relevant user data to the reusable element using the display data action.

This method works **both** directions: passing data from the parent to the reusable element or vice versa.
 Custom states

You can also pass data from the parent page to a reusable element using the *Set state of an element* action:

- Set up the relevant custom state with the correct data type on the reusable element. The custom state needs to be create on the parent reusable element, not any of its children
- Use the *Set state of an element* action to populate the custom state with data

This method works in **both** directions: passing data from the parent to the reusable element or vice versa.
 URL parameters

​URL parameters do not pass data directly into a reusable element per sé, but since they can be read and manipulated by both the page and any reusable element within that page, they can be a useful way to share information between the two.

This method works in **both** directions: passing data from the parent to the reusable element or vice versa.
 Reusable element properties

Reusable elements also come with customizable properties that can be set up to share dynamic data between it and other elements such as the parent page.

![reusable-element-add-new-property@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F0zvj3X408TvUpGQsbiPU%2Freusable-element-add-new-property%402x.png?alt=media&token=1bbe07a6-3785-4d32-acf9-4702610fc4d2)

Properties can be populated by a default value assigned on the reusable element itself or from the parent. Any new property that you add will be assigned a field on each instance of that reusable element placed on a page, and they can be individually assigned data.

The data populated in the fields are prioritized in order of 1) data assigned from the parent, and 2) default data, meaning that the data from the parent element takes priority.

Unlike custom states (that require an action to be assigned a value), reusable element properties let you use dynamic data. Unlike the *Type of content* field that all resuable elements have, you can set up as many different properties as you need, each with individual data types.
 Reusable element property types

You set select one of three types for any new property.

- **Dynamic value** lets you assign any basic data type or custom data type that you can then populate using a dynamic expression, such as a database search, an option set or something else. This is useful for passing different types of data dynamically to and from the reusable element.
- **Color picker** lets you assign a hex color code or a saved color variable. This is useful for dynamically passing a color value to the reusable element. You can then use that color to communicate something to your users, such as a different background, button or text color.
- **Checkbox** is a simple way to pass a yes/no value to or from the reusable.

This method works in **both** directions: passing data from the parent to the reusable element or vice versa.
 Passing data both ways

Let's revisit the point that reusable element properties can pass data not only *to* a reusable element, but *from* the element to the parent. This value can then be read by any element on the parent, allowing you to pass dynamic data to other elements on that page without having to use actions.

The fact that you can keep dynamic values updated automatically between a reusable element and its parent opens up for scenarios where you can use the reusable element to store different variables that you use elsewhere on the page and manage from one place.
 Adding an existing reusable element to a page

To add an existing reusable element to a page, navigate to the *Reusable elements* section of the element tree, click the element that you want to add, and then click on the area where you want to add it to a page.

![add-reusable-element-to-page@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FSNtM0hbj7MI3E3hnJhM6%2Fadd-reusable-element-to-page%402x.png?alt=media&token=3125a353-b520-4b36-969e-5a628984c85c)

Every reusable element you create will be added to the *Reusable element* section of the element tree.
 Modifying dimensions

Reusable elements' dimensions are defined when you edit the element itself. However, these elements are responsive (except if you make them fixed width), and if you need to resize them in the destination page you can do so, and the content will adjust as defined with the responsive settings of the inner elements.

 Styling

This section covers the different styling properties that can be applied to elements, such as colors, borders, shadows and fonts.
 What is styling

Each element that you add to your page has a default *styling* applied to it. In short, styling refers to **what your elements look like**, and this is done by changing styling settings:

- Background color or image
- Border
- Shadow
- Font
- Transitions

The settings above open up for a wide range of different looks where to elements that perform exactly the same task can look very different.

![input-element-styles@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fh9JLq3DuB9zeRmeYLgy6%2Finput-element-styles%402x.png?alt=media&token=0b519836-cb26-446d-b4c2-fb6a778c4c69)

These two input element serve the same purpose, but their styles are different. The bottom one seems to hover above the page – an effect often used to draw attention to a particular element.

Each element can be styled individually by opening the Property Editor and making changes to the settings in the *Appereance* tab:

You can tweak the style settings of each individual element, but Bubble also offers tools to set up stylesheets that you can manage from one place.
 Managing styles

But Bubble also has several different tools for efficiently managing and updating the styles of your app's elements. They are split into three different sections:

> **Color variables: save colors and apply them to elements and styles**

> The Color Variables feature in the Styles tab enables you to establish a palette of **colors** that you can apply throughout your app. Making changes in a Color variable automatically applies those changes to every style and element connected to that variable.

> Article: [Color variables](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/styling/color-variables)​

> **Font variables: save fonts and apply them to elements and styles**

> The Font Variables feature in the Styles tab enables you to establish a collection of **fonts** that you can apply throughout your app. Making changes in a Font variable automatically applies those changes to every style and element connected to that variable.

> Article: [Font variables](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/styling/font-variables)​

> **Styles: save and manage style properties that can be applied to elements**

> The *Styles* tab in Bubble provides you with a centralized place to define and manage all of your app's style settings.

> Styles create a consistent, visually appealing design for your app while making it easier to update that design in the future. Making changes to a style automatically applies those changes to every element connected to it. Article: [Styles](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/styling/styles)​

 Color variables

This section covers Color variables, used to set a palette of colors that can be applied throughout your app

The Color Variables feature in the Styles tab enables you to establish a palette of colors that you can apply throughout your Bubble app. Each color variable contains:

- A `hex code` that determines the color value
- An `alpha value` that controls its transparency

By incorporating both color and font variables, you can establish a consistent design system for your app. Using a color variable in the styling of an element creates a connection to the color value specified in the *Styles* tab.

![color-variable-editor@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FxtgBUHqt6bc82yu9efKj%2Fcolor-variable-editor%402x.png?alt=media&token=37f1f264-cee4-462d-8500-427c0c06ffe4)

You access the Color Variable editor from the *Styles* tab.

As a result, if you need to modify the color, you only have to make the change in one place and it will automatically be reflected wherever that color variable is used, saving you the hassle of adjusting each element or style separately.
 Do Color variables apply to styles?

Yes, Color variables apply to styles, meaning that if you update a Color variable it will automatically be updated on all styles that use that variable. By combining the two you can set up a highly flexible color system that lets you control the color appearance of your elements from one place.

![color-variables-in-styles@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FHfMnDijEyXACLRGQQ9KH%2Fcolor-variables-in-styles%402x.png?alt=media&token=21722d38-88bb-44e2-8660-c05efdc68852)

 Font variables

This section covers Font variables, used to manage a collection of fonts that can be applied to elements and styles throughout your app

Font variables allow you to centralize font settings and make changes to the font across multiple elements and styles. Instead of having to manually adjust font families in each instance they are used, you can simply modify the font variable in one place and watch the change propagate throughout your app.

![font-variables-in-styles@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FReYMFMHQOUhQMv2vJ87c%2Ffont-variables-in-styles%402x.png?alt=media&token=ee794792-29ea-4258-bc5d-6b2eeff134be)

Font variables can be connected with styles. In the image below, the two top options in the font list are Font variables. Whenever a variable changes, that change will propagate to all Styles and elements.

For newly created apps, the default styles will be set to the "App Font" by default.

> > For apps built before the launch of the Font variables feature, you have the option to switch to the "App Font" either in the individual element appearance settings or in the Element Styles section of the Styles tab
 Do Font variables apply to Styles?

Yes, Font variables apply to styles, meaning that if you update a Font variable it will automatically be updated on all styles that use that variable. By combining the two you can set up a flexible styling system that lets you make future changes with ease.

----
 Styles

This section covers styles, which is Bubble's tool for managing centralized stylesheets that can be applied to elements across your app

Bubble lets you set up overarching *styles* for elements within your app to streamline the design process and promote consistency. By modifying a single style, you can effortlessly restyle all related elements, making it easy to set up and manage a cohesive look and feel in your app.

Each style is connected to a specific element type and includes the following information (that may vary depending on the element type):

- Background color or image
- Border
- Shadow
- Font
- Transitions

Apart from making the design process more efficient, Styles also improves your app's performance by storing styling settings in one central place as opposed to saving it on each separate element.

Styles can be combined with Color variables and Font variables to set up a design system that's highly efficient and flexible.
 Defining styles

The *Styles* tab is where you edit the different styles that your app has. Editing styles is very similar to editing elements, you use the property editor to change the styling properties.

You can define as many styles as you want. Styles are applied to one type of element, for instance Buttons, but you can have more than one style for Button. Try to name them in a way is easy to read, as you'll have to pick the style that you need for each button. You can also specify which style should be used by default when you insert a new element in this tab.

You can create a from the *Style* tab by clicking on 'New Style', or from an element itself. When you do so from an element, the current properties of the element will be used as a base for the newly created style. This is particularly useful when you find yourself using the same design for a few elements, but haven't thought about creating a style yet. Please note that when creating your own Styles, specialized labels such as H1 for headers cannot be used.

![Desktop 2017-03-03 at 3.59.14 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smssh8MWZH_I7gkKf%2FDesktop%202017-03-03%20at%203.59.14%20PM.png?generation=1587943297760986&alt=media)
 Applying & removing styles
 Conditions on styles

You can build some conditions on styles, but only for *basic* states, that is to say conditions that are about built-in, simple interactions with the element (hovered, focused, etc.) For instance, conditions using data, or properties on the user, will not qualify as basic.
 Applying and detaching styles

When you apply a style to an element, its current properties that are included in the style will be deleted. On the other hand, when you detach a style from an element, the original properties of the style will be copied to the element. So effectively, when you detach a style from a button, the button's appearance won't change at first, so that you can modify the appearance. You can always undo such changes.

Detaching a style does not change or deleted the style, it only detaches it from that specific element.

![apply_style.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smssjQb9PFP75l0pN%2Fapply_style.png?generation=1587943297426598&alt=media)

To detach a style, click the *Detach style* link underneath the Styles dropdown in the property editor.
 Conflicts between conditions

You can overwrite a condition that is included in a style at the element level; between a style's condition and an element's condition, if the same property is modified, the condition at the element level will win.

​
 Using Style Variables

Style variables are used to store specific colors and fonts that can then be applied to elements and styles throughout your app. This ensures that your use of fonts and colors remains consistent and is easy to switch out later if needed: for example, replacing a color variable will update *all* styles that use this variable instantly.

You can read more about [color variables](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/styling/color-variables) and [font variables](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/styling/font-variables) in our dedicated articles.

 Custom Fonts

Bubble uses [Google Web Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for text types. This is a big library of open-source fonts that can be freely used, and the font files are stored on a Google server. Your easiest option when designing in Bubble is to use one of the fonts available in this library.

> > The Google Web Fonts library is so widely used that there's a fair chance that fonts you use are already cached in the browser of many of your users. In essence, this means that another website already has loaded the font for you and the user doesn't need to download it again.

> > This leads to a faster page load and smaller total page size.

Sometimes you will want to install your own font. For example, you might need the design to adhere to a style guide for a particular brand and use a commercial font that they have licensed.

This guide shows you how to install a custom font in your app. Once a font has been installed in your app, you will see it at the top of the list in the font dropdown.

> **Video lesson**

> Video: [How to set up a custom font](https://youtu.be/DVokzCUTC1s)​
 Installing a custom font

The Custom Font section for your app is in the Settings tab, General & Design section. This is where you can add new fonts, and remove the existing ones if you do not need them anymore. In general, having fonts that are not used in the app will slow down page load, so we recommend only keeping fonts that are actually used in your pages.

You add a custom font by entering the path of the CSS file that represents the font. This assumes that the font file is accessible on a web-server. Note that if the resource is not served over HTTPS, your application may not be able to load the file if it is itself on HTTPS. In general, using the raw font files and uploading them to Bubble's storage is the safest way to ensure proper loading.

Adding a custom font from the raw font files can be a little technical, as you will need to upload the different files, create some CSS files and upload them as well. Here is how you should do this.

First, get the font files (for instance, download this one [http://www.fontsaddict.com/fontface/free-sans.ttf4](http://www.fontsaddict.com/fontface/free-sans.ttf)/) and upload it to Bubble. To do that, just use a file uploader in Bubble, draw it on the page, and upload the file as the initial content. Once this is done you'll see a link below, just copy this link.

It should look like /`/s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/f1482852801693x129632627358660100/FreeSans.ttf`

Then, create a .css file in a text editor and copy the code you got from the site that offers the font.

```javascript
@font-face {
font-family: 'Free Sans';
src: url('[http://www.fontsaddict.com/fontface/free-sans.ttf](http://www.fontsaddict.com/fontface/free-sans.ttf)');
}
```

and replace the URL by what you got in 1.

```javascript
@font-face {
font-family: 'Free Sans';
src: url('[https://s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/f1482852801693x129632627358660100/FreeSans.ttf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/f1482852801693x129632627358660100/FreeSans.ttf)');
}
```

Note that we added `https:` in front of the URL.

Save this file font.css (for instance, the name does not matter), and upload it to Bubble as well, doing the same thing you did for the first step. It will return you a link that will look as well like

`//s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/f1482852801693x129632627328660100/font.css`

This is what you enter in the Settings tab. The name is the font name, and the path is the result of 3.

> > **Note:** Special characters in fonts are not automatically added and will default to Times. They can be manually added however, when adding your custom font as a . For example, lets say you are adding the following Google Webfont to your Bubble app:  **<**link href="link href= “h[ttps://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;700”](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;700) rel="stylesheet">  **I**t is recommended that you add a second link with any special characters you'd like to include using the '&text=' parameter:  **<**link href="link href= “h[ttps://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;700”](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;700) rel="stylesheet">  **Note:** Special characters in fonts are not automatically added and will default to Times.

 Responsive design
 What is responsive design?

[](https://youtu.be/vy1YqP5RUlc)

Responsive design is a method that gives your users a great experience no matter what kind of device they are using to access your app.

![responsive-devices.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FfXVCKzsjRHRCrXwaL8a7%2Fresponsive-devices.jpg?alt=media&token=3cc54534-688d-4c1e-b276-53a94eaca13e)

Responsive design ensures your app looks as intended on all resolutions and screen sizes by adjusting the layout and content to fit properly.

Instead of having to set up separate pages for different devices, the goal of responsive design is to create a single page that automatically adjusts its layout and content to fit the screen size and resolution of the device being used to access it.

Responsive design is important for several reasons:

- It gives the broadest number of users access to your app as they can access from all types of devices
- It reduces development time since you don't need to design and maintain separate pages
- Search engines tend to favor pages that are accessible on all devices which can help these pages rank higher​
 Bubble's responsive engine

Bubble features a design environment that lets you control every aspect of your app's responsiveness in the same visual editor that you use to build your pages. It uses a grid-based layout to change the appearance of the page depending on the screen size and orientation of the device.

For example, on a larger screen like a desktop computer, your page might have a three-column layout with a navigation menu, main content area, and a sidebar. But on a smaller screen, such as a smartphone, the same page might rearrange its content into a single column layout with a "hamburger" menu icon to access the navigation.

In the next article we'll explore the basics of how this design method works.

Article: [Building responsive pages](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/responsive-design/building-responsive-pages)​
 Other ways to learn

> **Video lessons**

> Bubble's responsive engine is a feature that was introduced in 2022. In older applications you may need to activate the feature on a page-by-page basis and convert those pages to the new engine.

 Building responsive pages
 Parent-child relationships

As we explored in the [section about Bubble elements](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements), the design of your app consists of a hierarchy of parent-child relationships. The page itself is the parent of all other elements, and on that page you can place *Containers* that become the parent of elements inside it.

![parent-child.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FK8m1zbbYK5F9bKwBWu6L%2Fparent-child.jpeg?alt=media&token=a1d339ff-2069-4aec-9c03-d4d508e83655)

In this example, the group that contains all the other elements is the **parent** and the input fields and button are all **children** of that group.

Containers can also contain containers, making the former the parent of the latter and you can build as many levels of this parent-child relationship as you need. This makes up the basis for the building responsive pages.

In this guide we will illustrate the parent container with a dashed border, as exemplified below:

![container-element@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Frw8wqCMpZBszBHzw7lrz%2Fcontainer-element%402x.png?alt=media&token=428b666e-0fea-426f-b873-e0929e180ecc)

The parent container will be highlighted with a dashed line throughout this guide.
 Parent settings and element settings

Setting up the responsive behavior of a given element is done by mixing the settings on the parent container and the element itself. If the element is placed directly on the page, that page is the parent container, but if you place it into a container element, the settings on that element will affect all its child elements.

The settings on the **parent container** determines where the elements are positioned relative to the container and each other. For example, they can be positioned vertically (in rows) or horizontally (in columns). The settings on the container is also used to determine the alignment of the overall layout (such as determinging whether a row should start on the left or right side of the container), the total dimensions of all the content and the spacing between rows and columns

The settings on the **child elements** determines the layout settings to that element in particular: how tall and wide should it be? How much room should the element maintain around and inside of itself (padding and margin) relative to the parent element and sibling elements?
 Container layout settings

Each container element (including the page itself) has a *Layout* setting, and this setting controls the behavior of all the elements inside of it. You can see the different Layouts as a set of rules that tells the children inside of it how to position themselves.

![container-layout@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FYa8vFfvXyYsTLKUircKM%2Fcontainer-layout%402x.png?alt=media&token=b440268c-0cb8-42f7-b700-f66c57b6dc51)

The container layout is located in the *Layout* tab of the Property Editor for the container (parent) element.

Their position then is based on three factors:

- The layout setting of the parent container
- The layout settings on the element itself
- The settings and position of its sibling elements (the other elements inside of the same container)

There are four types of layouts on the **container elements**:

- Fixed
- Align to Parent
- Column
- Row
 Fixed layout

Fixed layout lets you move and place an element freely within the parent container and it will position itself on that point. The position is set in an absolute X and Y pixel value, and the size of the element in a W(idth) and H(eight) value.

The position is relative to the parent element: in other words, the element will be positioned exactly X and Y pixels from the top left corner of the parent container.

In the animation below you can see that the button can be positioned freely in the parent element. The red outline on the parent group container indicates that the element will be (remain in this case) a child of that group.

![absolute-positioning.gif](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FH2f9eXktenBA51vacjnj%2Fabsolute-positioning.gif?alt=media&token=7c1cf4fd-10ac-486f-b872-9983a97d04da)

Fixed layout lets you set an absolute X and Y position using drag and drop.

The use of fixed layout can be useful in certain scenarios but can be a bit more challenging to manage on different screen sizes and resolutions.

![coordinates@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FORzD1yxppyMEUEFfHoIo%2Fcoordinates%402x.png?alt=media&token=883b54e0-2dff-4024-889e-536d46620133)

The four values highlighted above determine the element's width, height, X position and Y position .

 Align to parent layout

Align to parent divides the parent element into a nine-cell grid and lets you align child elements to any of the cells. In the illustration below you can see how a rectangular group is divided into upper-left, upper-middle, upper-right and so forth.

![CleanShot 2023-02-14 at 19.44.57.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FTuqU0iZOz6GR9DgTVQYu%2FCleanShot%202023-02-14%20at%2019.44.57.png?alt=media&token=fa9c1efa-8852-41a1-b611-45d60434e596)

The Align to parent layout lets you align child elements to one of the cells in a nine-cell grid.

If you create a new child element or drag and drop one, it will automatically snap to the nearest cell:

![align-to-parent.gif](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FoXx3kRDCjvBgqNzwvnjH%2Falign-to-parent.gif?alt=media&token=e0c86c88-257c-4290-bdde-ff63fabc1412)

You can also control the position of the element by opening the Property Editor for the child element. Each of the arrows below represent the different cells of the parent container:

![align-to-parent-property-editor@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FnUSxhYtMTO9urVnbkoKj%2Falign-to-parent-property-editor%402x.png?alt=media&token=6ed9bd5f-4ded-4ff4-aa9a-72bb04ca7934)
 Multiple elements

If you want to place multiple elements in the same cell, such as the top left, you may find that the elements overlap. If you want them to align themselves relative to each other, you can place them within a second group and set a different layout for that group.
 Parent and child layout settings (align to parent layout)
 Parent Layout Controls

 Row layout

Child elements in a row container are aligned one after the other horizontally. The child elements will wrap as the screen is resized or the total width of the elements exceeds the parent containers width.

![row-layout.gif](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fsr5hTmtAgJJeheSiHxTb%2Frow-layout.gif?alt=media&token=7ade4702-80de-4dad-a7fc-ee43d1d0ba1b)

Each element added to a row layout will be positioned at the end of the row, and wrap if the total width of the child elements exceeds the width of their parent container.

New child elements drawn inside the container will be added to the end of the list by default but can be re-ordered using the order controls or by dragging and dropping.

![order-controls@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FMBwTilQgR03H3Tvy8Lj1%2Forder-controls%402x.png?alt=media&token=6a261939-61f7-4c2e-ac24-2e58d9df6d3c)

Elements can be reordered by dragging and dropping or by using the buttons in the Property Editor.

Child elements in a column layout will be place on top of each other, regardless of the width they take up:

![column-layout.gif](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FftApaGdnPBtnOfTyPMuT%2Fcolumn-layout.gif?alt=media&token=66f2cffe-98c1-4741-8455-9b9ff288a05c)

Each element will be placed at the bottom of the column.

In the example above, the parent group is set to stretch as the content of it expands. As more and more elements are made visible, the height of the group increases automatically:

![stretch-height.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FB8VSm9UKGKIDzrHUf4rs%2Fstretch-height.png?alt=media&token=22e983b9-d2a6-4ab6-a5ff-3eafb82c9eac)

For the *Fit height to content* setting to work as expected, the minimum and maximum height must be set accordingly.

 Alignment

In row and column layout, you can set the alignment of child elements: where should the row or column start? For example, in a column layout the child elements stack on top of each other: should that stack start at the bottom or at the top of the container element?

Alignment is used both to determine the element's starting position, and how they should be spread out across the parent container.

You can read more about each individual layout setting in our core reference article about row and column layouts. You'll find the section about [rows](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/container-layout-typerow) here and columns [here](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/container-layout-typecolumn).
 Element layout settings

In the above section we covered how a container's layout settings affect its child elements. In this part we'll have a look at how the settings on each individual child element is used.

![element-alignment@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fom8S8rqWOGcnchqDLmxT%2Felement-alignment%402x.png?alt=media&token=4f523091-2c87-49c4-a7aa-3a7d5aa82c52)

An element's alignment properties determine how the element should be positioned within the constrainta set by its parent container.

In short the element settings are used to control the behavior of that specific element, as opposed to the container layout settings that affect *all* child elements. On the element you can set stuff like:

- How **wide** should the element be?
   - No restriction
   - Fixed width
   - Minimum/maximum width
   - Stretch with content
- How **tall** should the element be?
   - No restrictions
   - Fixed height
   - Minimum/maximum height
   - Stretch with content
- How should the element be **aligned** relative to the parent containers layout
- Should the element collapse its width/height when its hidden?
- Margin/Padding

As you can see from the settings, this gives you the freedom to control how individual elements behave *within* the constraints you have set on the parent container.

![container-width@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FNfZy5kElSUpCQoep2n5a%2Fcontainer-width%402x.png?alt=media&token=cc50f778-c81c-4849-b41b-d657f2411748)

The container's layut setting is column, making the child elements stack vertically. But their width is set on an element level, as illustrated in the example above.
 Using the Responsive Viewer

You will find a tab above the New Element palette that lets you switch between the UI Builder view, where you can modify elements, drag new ones, and delete some, and the Responsive Viewer which lets you manage screen widths, known as breakpoints, and test how your page behaves as the breakpoint changes. In this view, the ruler at the top of the page area defines the current page width. Just click or drag on the ruler to resize the page and see how the page behaves dynamically.

You can also use the preset width icons on the left side of the screen to see how the page looks on mobile in portrait mode, in landscape mode, on a tablet and on a laptop or a desktop.

When you click on an element, the Layout tab in the Property Editor will display the different parameters you can modify to affect its behavior.
 Managing Breakpoints

Your Bubble app comes with a Default breakpoint, four preset breakpoints, and the ability to add custom breakpoints. The Default breakpoint is equal to the Default builder width value that is set for that page.

The four presets are:

- Mobile (320 px)
- Mobile Landscape (768 px)
- Tablet (992 px)
- Desktop (1200 px)

You can use any of your app’s breakpoints to test the page behavior on the Responsive Viewer tab and as data sources to set “Current page width” conditionals on any element.

**Viewing breakpoints**

All Bubble preset breakpoints are initially added to the page’s toolbar for ease of use. Any other breakpoints are added to the toolbar when the breakpoint is being use as a data source in a conditional on the page.

Breakpoints listed in the breakpoints dropdown are all the presets and custom breakpoints that exist in the app.

**Creating a new custom breakpoint**

You can create a new custom breakpoint by clicking “Add custom” within the breakpoints dropdown.

**Editing breakpoints**

You can edit any breakpoint on the toolbar or in the breakpoints dropdown.

Editing a custom breakpoint will edit the data source and update the breakpoint wherever it is referenced in the app.

Editing a preset breakpoint will create a new custom breakpoint and update any reference of the breakpoint to the new custom breakpoint.

Example: Changing the preset breakpoint Mobile from 320 px to 325 px will result in the creation of a custom breakpoint named Mobile (Custom) (325 px) and all references to Mobile will now reference Mobile (Custom) (325 px).

**Removing and deleting breakpoints**

You can remove any breakpoint from the toolbar, but this does not delete it as an available data source.

You can delete any breakpoint from the breakpoints dropdown. Deleting a breakpoint from the dropdown will remove it from any pages that are using it. This will in turn unlink it from any referenced conditionals and flag an issue in the issue checker to fix those conditionals.

 The Basics (Legacy)

This page covers educational material relevant to the Legacy Bubble Editor.

The Bubble Visual Editor is based on the What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) principle. You can position elements where you want, down to the pixel, and your app will look like that in Run-mode. These are the basics to keep in mind when you are building an interface.
 Parent-Children relationship

Some elements can be containers (found in the container section of the New Element palette), and all elements in Bubble belong to a parent. The page itself is the top parent, and all elements on the page will have the page as their parent. To draw an element inside a container, move your mouse over the container, and you'll notice the borders turn red. Once an element is inside a container, its behavior will follow the parent's behavior, both in Edit and Run-mode. For instance, if you move an element in the editor, the children will stay at the same place relative to their parent. In Run-mode, if you hide a parent, any element inside the container will be hidden as well and, if you show a parent, any element inside it will become visible too. Dragging an element lets you change its parent.

The Elements Tree on the left lets you see the structure of your page, and also show/hide elements to better edit and organize them. Many elements will be hidden by default, and you will be able to access them clicking on the eye icon (this will show all parent elements that are also hidden, if necessary).

![Desktop 2017-03-07 at 6.27.14 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smw-9b197W2NfKmDJ%2FDesktop%202017-03-07%20at%206.27.14%20PM.png?generation=1587943317264293&alt=media)

The Element Tree has two modes. You can either decide to show all elements on the page in a tree view, with parents and children, or only show hideable elements. Hideable elements are elements that are hidden on page load (from which you have unchecked the box 'This is element is visible on page load'). In other words, you will only see these elements in the list when the option 'only show hideable elements' is checked. This is a useful feature when editing a page because it lets you quickly show elements that aren't visible for editing purposes, while the other mode is useful to get a full view of the page.
 Absolute positioning

Elements in Bubble are positioned absolutely, using coordinates (X, Y) that position the element relative to its parent. That way, you have full freedom to position elements wherever you want on the page. This is different from many visual HTML/CSS editors that constrain you to position elements inside some boxes on the page. While it offers more freedom, it also means you need to be careful to have a clean design, and will need to understand Bubble's responsive page settings.
 Responsive design

Bubble pages are responsive. In other words, they will adjust to the width of the page so that they look great on mobile devices. Since you can position elements to the pixel, you may have to configure a few settings for your page to behave properly as its width changes.
 Editing elements

You add a new element on the page by clicking the type of element you want to add on the visual element panel on the left-hand side (the New Element Palette), and then drawing that element on the page. Once an element is drawn on the page, you can move it by dragging it around, and edit its properties by double-clicking on it. With a few exceptions, most elements are draggable and resizable; Popups are modal containers that appear on the top of the page, and are always centered on the page. Therefore, they are not draggable. When you double click on an element, it reveals the Property Editor, which lets you modify the element fields.
 Naming elements

[](https://youtu.be/TTHxOghuBjU)

Watch our Academy quick tip for recommendations on naming your elements

You can edit the name of your element in the top of its Property Editor. Select the existing name and start typing. Conventions for naming your elements is entirely up to you. For example, you could simplify each element name and write what it does next to it, such as “btn submit," or you could capitalize the first word all together or use underscores. Whichever convention you pick, make sure to use it throughout your app. The consistency will help you locate your elements and debug your design as your app grows.

By default, Bubble names new elements by its type. If we add a button, Bubble will name it "Button A" if there are no other buttons on the page, or "Button B" if there is a button already. If you change the contents of that element to include text, Bubble will take that text and change the name of the element for you. For example, if we change this button's text to "Submit," the name will update to "Button Submit." You might have several "Submit" buttons throughout your application, so it's a good practice to name your elements as you go along so that you can keep track of each.
 Types of Elements

There are three main types of elements: Visual elements, Containers, and Input forms.

- Visual elements are elements that display some information, or UI elements that users can interact with by clicking. However, users will usually not be able to type any information into them.
- Containers are elements that contain other elements. Their visibility will impact the visibility of their children, and they can have a defined type of content.
- Input forms are elements where users can enter information. The most common case will be an input form where one can type some text.

While each element has its own fields (for instance, input elements have placeholder colors), most Bubble elements have some shared styling properties. These properties can be used to change the background, borders, shadows, font style, etc. Most of these general properties will be modifiable in the Styles tab too.

 Building Responsive Pages (Legacy)

This page covers educational material relevant to the Legacy Bubble Editor.

Bubble pages are responsive. In other words, they will adjust to the width of the page so that they look great on mobile devices. Since you can position elements to the pixel, you may have to configure a few settings for your page to behave properly as its width changes.
 Building responsive pages

You should start designing the page as it should appear on a wide screen, for instance your laptop. Then, once you're done with the wide ("laptop") design, you can start working on narrower designs. That's what the Responsive Viewer is for. The responsive view lets you modify a few parameters that will change how the page behaves when it's being squeezed.

![Responsive.gif](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smuTUA0PIEfTN1LjL%2FResponsive.gif?alt=media)
 Using the Responsive Viewer

You will find a tab above the New Element palette that lets you switch between the Builder View, where you can modify elements, drag new ones, and delete some, and the Responsive Viewer which lets you test your page under different configurations and modify the responsive behavior of each element. In this view, the ruler at the top of the page area defines the current page width. Just click or drag on the ruler to resize the page and see how the page behaves dynamically. You can also use the preset width icons on the left side of the screen to see how the page looks on iPhone in portrait mode, in landscape mode, on an iPad and on a laptop or a desktop. When you click on an element, the Responsive Palette will display the different parameters you can modify to affect its behavior. Modify the different settings and you’ll see how it impacts the page in real time.
 Understanding the Responsive Algorithm

The algorithm that controls how the page is rendered follows a few core principles. While you can tweak and see in real time the impact of the responsive parameters, it is good to have an overall understanding of how the rendering engine works.

- In general, as the page gets resized, elements shrink and expand before margins do. Bubble only expands margins if all elements on a line are at their maximum widths, and only shrinks margins if all elements are at their minimum widths and everything that could break to the next line is already on the next line.
- By default, most elements are shrinkable and expandable. You can control this on an element-by-element basis in the Property Editor or the Responsive Viewer.
- Overlapping elements move together: they expand or shrink together (unless one of the elements is set to fixed width or has a maximum width). In other words, overlapping elements both break, or neither breaks, and they are both shown or neither is shown by any show/hide rules.
- Groups (and other containers, such as Repeating Groups) work like mini-pages. Elements can break to new lines inside of them. By setting a minimum width on a group, you can stop that from happening by limiting how far the group can squeeze its contents. And by setting a maximum width, you’ll limit how wide an element can be. For instance, if you want your page to not be as wide as the screen, you can put all your elements in a group and apply a maximum width for that group.
 Using the Responsive Debugger

Bubble offers a responsive debugger, both in Run-mode (if the debugger is on) and in the Responsive Viewer (click on the grid icon in the Top Bar). Activating that mode will let you see how the page is structured, and how the elements on the page are grouped together. For example, this can reveal floating groups that hover over elements and make them unexpectedly unclickable, or why elements have more space than expected between them. To activate this in run mode, when the debugger is on, click "Show responsive boxes" under the "Inspect" button. This is important because behind the scenes, a Bubble responsive page is structured into lines and boxes, and these two concepts will help to refine the responsive behavior of your page.

- Elements get grouped into boxes. Everything in a box moves together (for instance, overlapping elements are always in the same box). Boxes are the things that can break to the next line, and get shown and hidden. The left-most element in a box is the one that controls its show / hide rules (see below for what these rules are about).
- Lines are horizontal rows of boxes. Lines are as tall as the tallest thing in them, and everything in the next line is below the line above it. Boxes can break to a new line if there's no space for them on their current line.

![Screen_Shot_2016_04_15_at_4.46.51_PM.png](https://dd7tel2830j4w.cloudfront.net/f1460753235049x912985536735504900/Screen_Shot_2016_04_15_at_4.46.51_PM.png?)
 Responsive parameters

You can tweak how an element/page behaves as the page is resized with the responsive parameters. They are accessible from the Property Editor and the Responsive Palette (when you’re in the Responsive Viewer). Understanding responsive settings is easier when you see the actual impact of the different settings. We strongly recommend watching this [17-minute video](https://vimeo.com/169882386), as it will illustrate the different options you can use as you build responsive page.

> > **Note:** Instagram technically uses its own browser, which is not officially supported by Bubble. Bubble pages will still load in Instagram's browser, but if this is a major use case for you, we recommend you test your pages on this browser first.

> > **Note:** If you reference a third-party library in the raw Javascript on a page to modify an element, the way the modified element updates responsively (i.e. as the screen width changes) might not behave as expected, so it's always a good idea to test it thoroughly.

> > **Note:** Elements that are wider than the width of the page it's on can lead to unexpected behavior with the responsive engine. Consider making all elements no wider than the page width.

 Migrating Legacy Pages
 **Overview**

Bubble's Responsive Engine, the framework for how responsive web pages are built and rendered, has been re-designed from the ground up to provide a faster and more powerful way to build responsive layouts in Bubble. For those who may be more technical, the new engine is based on CSS and CSS flexbox properties. Regardless of your understanding of the underlying technologies though, the new responsive engine will run your app pages faster and give you more control over the behavior of your page as the screen or content re-sizes.

Because Bubble's Responsive Engine has been completely re-built, there are a number of new controls that your existing pages do not yet have access to. We'll walk through how to migrate any of your existing pages over to the new responsive engine so you can take advantage of this new, more powerful way to build.

Your page is on the Legacy rendering engine if it has a blue upgrade icon next to it. If it doesn't, feel free to skip this section!

​

​
 **Upgrading your Page**

Upgrading to the new Responsive Engine happens at the page level. To upgrade a particular, navigate to the desired page (new or existing) and click the “Upgrade responsive engine” button in the Responsive sub tab in the Design Tab. You now have access to the new responsive controls on this page!

​

![Screen Shot 2021-10-28 at 5.37.50 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F07ZAB4Lv2V59x8QIUfTd%2FScreen%20Shot%202021-10-28%20at%205.37.50%20PM.png?alt=media&token=29e12ed8-ff0b-4750-9f67-6a8b40440736)

​

Pages and reusable elements not yet upgraded will carry a blue upgrade icon in the page menu.

​

![Screen Shot 2021-10-28 at 5.35.26 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FV3ujJkk4WSlXFZLtqQ93%2FScreen%20Shot%202021-10-28%20at%205.35.26%20PM.png?alt=media&token=265f4de1-2ffb-4e0d-9fe2-a8cb901fe339)

​
 Converting an existing page

If you are upgrading an existing page, your old settings will be converted to the new system automatically. Depending on the migration option you choose, there will likely be some follow up work to make sure your page behaves as expected. You might even choose to re-build certain sections as the new controls allow for more powerful and cleaner ways to build your pages. In addition, the undo history will be reset when the page is upgraded.

We **strongly recommend** reviewing your upgraded page before deploying to Live to ensure the behavior matches your expectations. Some new controls are incompatible with the old rendering engine so not everything on your page will map 1:1 once it has been upgraded.

> > **Warning:** There is no way to downgrade a page once on the new Responsive Engine. There is, however, the option to **create a copy of the old page** in case you would like to return to that version at a later time. Selecting this option will create a copy of the page before the upgrade that can be found in your page menu. Keep in mind that this copy will not contain any changes you made to the UI after upgrading the page.

![Screen Shot 2021-11-09 at 2.39.16 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F58LhrqVofqJul0Jhfmp5%2FScreen%20Shot%202021-11-09%20at%202.39.16%20PM.png?alt=media&token=2d5dd371-b151-4d51-9e24-994a5d51bfd6)

Confirmation modal when converting an existing page
 Converted page layout

The migration algorithm tries its best to match the behavior of your page to the new responsive engine settings. Converted pages will generally have the following layout: Page is set to a column container layout type and will contain many groups set to a row container layout type. In turn, these row container layout types will contain the page content. This is because a column container organizes its content vertically and will expand or shrink based on its content. The row containers organize their content horizontally and allow the content to wrap or collapse as the screen resizes. In concert, a "column of rows" layout best matches the responsive behavior of legacy pages while now giving you more explicit control.

You may also choose to migrate your page "as-is." This setting copies your page over exactly as it appears in your editor, but everything will be absolutely positioned. You'll likely want to adjust the new layout settings on all of your elements to get your desired responsive behavior.

> > **Note:** Because most converted pages will now have a responsive container layout type, you will not be able to drag to resize elements like you're used to. With responsive containers, child elements need to follow rules as the screen or content resizes (*stay aligned to the left? Stretch to fit the width?*), and these rules are set in the Property Editor's Layout tab. Changing a container to a Fixed type will allow you to drag to resize, but the element will no longer behave responsively.
 Reusable Elements

Reusable elements must be updated separately to the new Responsive Engine as well. Legacy reusable elements won’t break upgraded pages, but will also not have access to the latest controls and might not work as expected. Similarly, upgrade reusable elements will not break un-upgraded pages, but will not take advantage of the new responsive controls and may not work as expected.
 Property Editor

The Property Editor has been updated to accommodate the new responsive controls. Most notably, a layout tab has been added to house the new responsive controls. The Property Editor is now the same across the UI Builder tab and Responsive tab, making it easier to continue building regardless of the tab you are in.
 Appearance

Controls related to the overall appearance of an element. This includes the data type, data source, styles, and transitions settings.
 Layout

Controls related to the overall layout of an element on the page. This includes the width, height, container layout type, page visibility, and margins.
 Conditionals

Conditionals allow you to control how page elements behave and appear under certain circumstances. This tab remains unchanged from before.

 Tips When Designing (Legacy)

There are a few things that you should get used to using or doing as you design your app.
 Finding elements

If your page has many elements, you may find it difficult to find elements to edit them. Here are a few ways you can find them easily.

- Use the Element Picker in the Top Bar. All the page elements are listed alphabetically; you can start typing a name and you'll see the different elements. When you hover an entry in the dropdown you will see a thumbnail to confirm this is the right element, and clicking on it will show it and select it. To make the best use of this, you should take the habit of naming your elements carefully.
- When two elements overlap, clicking on them by pressing CMD will select each element one-by-one, even if one is completely under another. Using this, you can select the element under all the others, without modifying your page layout.
- Clicking on the 'X-Ray' icon will make elements semi-transparent, which is handy combined with the CMD+click operation above.
- Use the Element Tree to have a clear view of the structure of your page.
- The App Search Tool is useful to find elements in the current page by type, or that contain a specific text, etc.
- If you find yourself moving some elements that should never be moved, you can add some protection in the Editor by checking the box 'Lock this element (not draggable in editor)'. This is purely for editing purposes, and can be handy when working on complex pages.
 Using the Inspector

When you start building a complex page, an element can be used in many different places, such as events, actions, or even in other elements. To help you have a centralized view of how an element is used in the interface, Bubble has an Element Inspector that will show these connections. In particular, it will show:

- The custom states the current element has, and lets you modify them, delete them, or add a new state
- The different events that are using the current element
- The different actions that are using the current element
- The other page elements that refer to the current element

To reveal the Element Inspector, click on the information icon in the Title Bar of the Property Editor.

![inspector.gif](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smu57kdySNibvmg3P%2Finspector.gif?alt=media)
 Choosing alignments

Having elements aligned is key in having a good, clean design. Bubble has a few tools to help you with this.

- *Snap to edges when dragging and resizing element*. By default, Bubble will try to snap elements to an existing line on the page. If you want to change this behavior and snap to a grid, you can control this in the Grid menu in the Top Bar.
- You can show a grid, control the step (in pixels) and the color of the lines.
- The Arrange menu offers some useful distribution features, for instance if you want the space between three elements to be equal. You can also center an element relatively to its parent (this is also possible by using the Shortcut CTRL + E).
 Using the Contextual Menu

Right-clicking on an element will reveal a Contextual Menu. You will find some clipboard options that can save you a lot of time, in particular copy formatting and copy conditional formatting. Using this feature will copy all the conditions and the modified properties in each of the conditions.

You can also replace an element by another type. For instance, if you realized that you want to use the Ionic Toggle instead of a Checkbox element, you can replace the element without having to delete it and rebuild it. Keep in mind that this can have some consequences on your app, as the type of data the element returns can be different. For instance, if you replace a checkbox by a date input. The Issue Checker will be useful to make sure you haven't introduced issues.

The Contextual Menu also offers a grouping feature, that will move all the selected elements into a new group. Lastly, you can decide to convert an element, or a group of element into a Reusable Element. This is particularly useful if you realize that a group of elements will be used in more than one place.
 Customizing color swatches

It is important to always use the same color (HEX code) across your pages, for design consistency. To ease this process, you can define some preset colors in the Settings tab, General & Design section, and then you'll be able to pick these colors wherever you access the color picker.

![Desktop 2017-03-03 at 5.14.35 PM.png](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smu59P_lOXtTRpka7%2FDesktop%202017-03-03%20at%205.14.35%20PM.png?alt=media)
 Building responsive pages

Building responsive pages can be a little unnatural at first. However, once you master the different parameters, you will be able to have very customizable behavior. As everything in Bubble, you have immediate feedback when you change a parameter, so tweaking is a good way to start. Here are a few techniques we've seen to be useful when designing a responsive page.

- Grouping elements is very useful when you want them to move together on the page. Select a few elements and right click on them to group them. You can also use the keyboard shortcut CTRL/CMD + G. Once this is done, you can define a max width, a min width, an alignment, etc. at the group level.
- If elements overlap, their behavior will be similar. So if you want to show a group when the width is higher than 500px, and show another one when the width is lower than 500px, it’s important to have these elements side by side, and to make sure they don’t overlap.
- If you need to have a screen-wide stripe, you can use a group (or a floating group to make it float at the top) and make it as wide as the page area in the builder view. If you don't set a maximum width, it will automatically extend to the edges of the screen.
- If you want the distance between two elements to get smaller as the page is resized (instead of the elements' widths being squeezed), using a transparent shape can be very helpful. Remember that the algorithm keeps the margins constant, and not the widths. So if an invisible shape is between two elements, it will get squeezed and the visual distance between the two elements will effectively get smaller as the page gets narrower.
- You can change fonts based on the screen width. The Current Page Width datasource is available in the conditional tab of each element, so you can have a smaller font based on the width. A good practice is to put this at the style level, so that all elements follow the same rule.
- There is a difference between a 'hiding rule' and using a conditional state that hides an element based on the current page width. The hiding rule is more powerful because when it gets applied (and hides an element), it frees some space for the other elements on the same line. Setting a condition doesn’t do this.
- If you want to have a radically different design for mobile, you can build a different page entirely. Just design another page and make this page the 'mobile version'.

 Templates

Templates allow you to import a pre-made app to get started with your project quickly. This is not just a *design* feature, as templates include both the design and workflows. The purpose of a template is to give you a more or less complete application of a given type to kickstart your project.

Templates cover a wide range of categories:

- Blog
- CRM
- Dashboard
- Game
- Landing Page
- Marketplace
- Online Store
- Portfolio
- Social Directory & Listings
- Professional Services
- On-demand Services
- Project Management
- Building Blocks
- Other

Having a look through the templates section before starting an app from scratch can be a good idea, as many app categories start out with the same framework, and you can build additional features on top of it. Using a template does not restrict your ability to customize it at all – it just gives you a faster start and you may avoid having to repeat tasks that others have done before you, such as setting up signup/login forms.

Note that you cannot add a template into an app after the app has been created.

Templates are found on the [Templates](https://bubble.io/templates) page.
 Creating an app using a template

On the [Templates](https://bubble.io/templates) page you can browse templates in different categories and pick one that suits your project. Clicking a template will give you a notification like the one below, and when you click *Use now* a new project will be created with the chosen template applied.

![use-template@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fc2ZofPTkkuIJTzfyc085%2Fuse-template%402x.png?alt=media&token=55e55284-926e-40ff-84be-75f016b22a5d)
 Reviewing Templates

When an app is created with a template, you will be able to review the template in the Editor (or in the template page). You will also be able to reveal your email to the template owner, which is useful if you need an answer. As the Ecosystem grows, it is important for the Community to regulate and provide feedback. We appreciate your help.

To leave a review, go the Template tab.

 The Component Library

The Component Library is a collection of pre-built User Interface (UI) components that can be dragged and dropped onto your page to help you build beautiful interfaces faster. These UI components are fully responsive and are made up of containers, visual elements, and form inputs that can be individually customized once added to your page. Each component is a fully independent unit, but can be connected to each other or other parts of your app by adding workflows and data.

This guide will show you how to use these components to build a beautiful landing page in seconds and how to wire up the Signup and Login forms for full user authentication.
 Build with components

The UI components in the Component Library allow you to build a fully responsive and customizable app in seconds.

First, change your page layout to a [Column](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/the-component-library) container layout type in the page's property editor. This will allow your components to stack vertically when added to your page and the content to resize appropriately as the screen width changes.

![Screenshot 2022-11-11 at 3.59.13 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FRoljZssDRbJrOQBBZ2Vj%2FScreenshot%202022-11-11%20at%203.59.13%20PM.png?alt=media&token=d52df585-d931-46cb-af25-71b06b377a2c)

Next, drag any number of components onto your page, one below the other. When dropping your component onto your page, the blue indicator on the editor canvas will tell you where it will land.

Components can be added within other groups, so make sure the blue indicator is at the very bottom of the last container.

![index page.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FeML1oth00NJNDljgCZs9%2Findex%20page.png?alt=media&token=058b682d-8f15-4df5-8a11-00e7dba98b2f)

Once you are done adding components, you will have a fully responsive landing page that can be customized to your liking.
 Customize your components

Now that the skeleton of your landing page has been built, each element can be customized to your liking. For example, you can change the text in any of the text boxes or buttons by selecting the element and updating its Appearance or replace any of the placeholder images by selecting the image and uploading a new one.

As you add additional pages to your application, you can update the placeholder links on your page to navigate to those pages by adding a `Go to page` workflow action when the link is clicked.

![Screenshot 2022-11-11 at 4.19.22 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FR6raviFRtHwYU7N1kcbR%2FScreenshot%202022-11-11%20at%204.19.22%20PM.png?alt=media&token=803cf457-9763-4431-922a-5c80e904376e)

To change the overall look and feel of your landing page, you can customize the font and color variables in the Style Variables subtab in the Styles tab. Since the font and colors used in each element is connected to a Variable, any changes made on the Style Variable level will cascade through your app automatically. Adjust the Style Variables so that your landing page matches your brand.

![Screenshot 2022-11-11 at 4.21.48 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FpucxLfrQg0hiVH3c8xVo%2FScreenshot%202022-11-11%20at%204.21.48%20PM.png?alt=media&token=1afb1901-493f-4bb7-8a05-8cbae00e8d96)
 Adding workflows for user authentication

User authentication is the foundation for almost every web application. By using the Header and Signup/Login components, you can set up a fully functionally signup and login flow in a handful of clicks.

Once you've added the Header and Signup/Login components onto your page, you'll need to connect the Signup and Login buttons in the Header to show the Signup/Login popup or the Signup/Login page, depending on the component you selected. Most of the workflows have already added to help you get started.

Open the *Workflow* tab of the page that contains the Signup/Login component, and you'll see two workflows titled *When an element is clicked*. The first workflow will control the Signup form and the second workflow will control the Login form.

Select the first workflow event and change the element to "Button signup (Header)." This connects the Signup button to the workflow that opens the Signup Form. Similarly, in the second workflow event, change the element to "Button login (Header)" to connect the Login button to the workflow that opens the Login Form.

![Screenshot 2022-11-11 at 4.35.26 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FW1EgVmFYAkwuiNz6PQd3%2FScreenshot%202022-11-11%20at%204.35.26%20PM.png?alt=media&token=65b47f1b-6530-42da-920f-bf1b9279be8a)

![Screenshot 2022-11-11 at 4.35.57 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FaVRfOsI6I6Tgy4EnroPj%2FScreenshot%202022-11-11%20at%204.35.57%20PM.png?alt=media&token=6c32a885-6428-46a0-9d48-e67bf141955d)

To sign the user up, start a workflow from the Signup button in the Signup form and add the "Sign the user up" workflow action. Here, you'll map the email input's value and password input's value to the workflow parameters so that the workflow action can register those two fields.

![Screenshot 2022-11-11 at 4.43.58 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fh7ucPaDugmhpbyd1zVsW%2FScreenshot%202022-11-11%20at%204.43.58%20PM.png?alt=media&token=187b5cb0-93ed-4a5b-8069-a7f4d41556a2)

Next, we need to add a new field to the User data type so we can capture the name of the user on signup. On the data tab, select the User data type and add a new Field of type text called "Name". Going back to the signup workflow, add a new action after "Sign the user up" called "Make changes to Current User". Here, you'll map the Name parameter to the Input Name's value to update the user you just signed up with the name they entered.

![Screenshot 2022-11-11 at 4.47.30 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FsAdo136R7jMIwGqaBcbM%2FScreenshot%202022-11-11%20at%204.47.30%20PM.png?alt=media&token=07b49e06-8f60-42e4-a8e0-4338a077ecf0)

As you continue building your app, you can add additional workflows here to navigate the user to the proper page after they sign up, or any other logic that your application needs.

To connect the Login button, start a workflow from the Login button and add the "Log the user in" workflow action. Just like with Signup, you'll map the email and password input's value from the Login form to the Email and Password parameters.

As you continue building your app, you can add additional logic here depending on what you want to happen after a user logs into your app.

![Screenshot 2022-11-11 at 4.52.02 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FNUpCAAG12Jsibn5Bw4BS%2FScreenshot%202022-11-11%20at%204.52.02%20PM.png?alt=media&token=aa05977f-5fcb-4cd5-aace-8c5eb53a0de6)

There you have it, your landing page is now connected to a full user authentication workflow!

 Importing from Figma

This feature will import your Figma design into your Bubble app. Due to the differences in the two platforms, the import will not be at 100% fidelity, but can give you a head start on the app design process.
 **How to import a Figma file**

- Go to *Settings > General* and scroll down to the *Design Import* section
- You can find your Figma API key by going to your Figma account settings
   - On your Figma dashboard page, click your name in the upper left, and then *Create a new personal access token* if you don’t have one already - this is your API key
- You can find the Figma File ID by looking at the URL when you have the file open in Figma
   - The URL should have the format [figma.com/file/](http://figma.com/file/){random letters and characters}, or [figma.com/file/](http://figma.com/file/){random letters and characters}/[slightly more readable name]; the file ID is the {random letters and characters}
- Clicking “Import” will begin the import, which can take a few minutes for large Figma files
 **How the import works**

- Every top-level frame in every page of your Figma file will be imported as a new page in your Bubble app
- Invisible items in Figma (made invisible in the layers sidebar) will not be imported
- Bubble tries to import as much from Figma as possible, mapping Figma elements to the closest kind of Bubble element
- Bubble will create groups out of elements that are grouped in Figma
- Names of elements in Figma will carry over to Bubble as well (note that there is a character limit on imported names and Bubble will avoid duplicate names)
- Bubble tries to create Styles to match styling from Figma, but in more complex situations (e.g. multiple styles in one piece of text), Bubble may make assumptions about the style to apply or use rich text markup (bbcode) for text
- Any kind of vector in Figma will be imported as an image in the app
   - Any group in Figma that contains only vectors is imported as a whole image (having sub-groups, even if they only have vectors themselves, will not trigger this rule)
- Images will source the image uploaded to Figma’s servers, i.e. images will not be automatically uploaded to your Bubble app
- Bubble will not make any assumptions about what’s a repeating group
- If a shape or frame has invisible fill, it carries as transparent fills

> > **Tip:** During the import, Bubble will treat every image as a separate image, even if two images are technically copies of one another. Also, in the event the Figma file has a large image (e.g. an SVG containing large embedded PNGs), Bubble will still faithfully try to import those (very large) images!
 **Known limitations**

- This is a one-way, one-time import and we do not maintain a link between a Bubble page and the Figma frame; if you trigger the import again, it will simply create a new Bubble page for each top-level Figma frame again
- If you experience a “Network error” upon trying to import:
   - First, check your ad-blocking / anti-tracking software, as that can sometimes block our call to Figma’s API
   - Please try again a little bit later; if you consistently experience this, please file it as a bug
- Because Figma allows tighter constraints around text boxes, Bubble will add to the height and width of text elements to get it closer to the Figma design
- Any styling that’s possible in Figma but not currently possible in Bubble will not be imported - though workarounds usually exist for implementing complex styling; these include:
   - No bottom vertical alignment for text
   - Can only have one shadow per element
   - Can do a max of 3 colors for gradients
   - Does not support multiple fills at the same time — Bubble only takes the first fill in an object
   - 0px rounded borders are overridden
- There are some other styling properties that we do not carry over yet, but which might come in a future release; examples include:
   - Having different border styling on different sides of an element
   - Elements that go off the frame towards the top or left

Note also that if you try importing a significantly large and complex Figma file, the import may timeout (this also depends on your computer's resources). If you're bumping into this limitation, try breaking up your Figma file into smaller files and importing those individually instead.
 **Tips for setting up your Figma file**

- Since this feature imports every frame in your Figma file, if you have a very large Figma file with many variants of a given page, you may want to copy a subset of frames to a new file to use in your import
- Remember that every top-level frame gets imported as a new page, and that the import is a one-time import. You may want to consider designing a Bubble page in chunks in Figma, and doing periodic imports to bring in new chunks into Bubble
- Great way to make mobile pages and add them directly to your application.
- Experiment with importing components from your Figma file all bundled into a frame so that you can easily copy / paste them while building your Bubble application
- You can outline elements as strokes with no issue; these will transfer over normally.
- If you want to import masked elements, create a group (not a frame) with the masked elements only. We look at a group to see if any of the elements in the group are masked - if a masked element is found, the whole group is imported as an image.
- If you’re experiencing trouble importing an image: Make sure you’re using the image object and not an image fill on a frame. Currently, we only support image objects (i.e. when you click “place an image” on Figma) and you can mask it with other objects as needed.
- If you’re experiencing problems with importing background fills: when frames are imported as pages, we don’t currently support fills for those pages. If the fill isn’t showing up for objects, inner frames, etc. please check and make sure there aren’t multiple fills. Bubble only supports a single fill for any element so we only choose one.
 **Troubleshooting**

- If you're encountering a "Network Error" or if Bubble does not consider your API Key and File ID to be valid, first try regenerating a new API Key in your Figma account...
- ...if that also does not work, try turning off any ad / tracking blockers you may have active.

 Data

This section covers the different ways you work with data in Bubble

This section takes a long-form look at how Bubble manages different types of data. To see the concise, technical description of data sources, operators, comparisons, search and privacy, you can check out our more concise [core reference entry on data](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data).
 Introduction

Working with data is the cornerstone of any application. In fact, it's such a central part of app development that it's hard to imagine an app that doesn't rely on it in some way. Whether it's data generated by users, owned by you or imported from other apps and services, the ability to collect, store, and visualize information is why most applications exist in the first place.

Think about it: a ride sharing app needs information about drivers, customers, locations and many other details to complete a transaction. A social media app needs user information, photos and user-generated content and a newspaper needs articles and images: they all collect, store and display their data in different ways, but in principle they all work in the same way.

> > The ability to work with data is what allows apps to do what they do best: **provide value to users.**

Not only do most apps by their most basic definition work with data, but they mostly all do it in the same way: by storing the data in a database.

In this section, we'll cover many topics related to data in Bubble:

- How to manage the data in your [database](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database)​
- ​[Managing files](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/files) uploaded by your and your users
- Working with [static data](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/static-data)​
- Working with [temporary data and variables](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/temporary-data)​
- ​[Managing users](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/user-accounts) and letting them sign up for an account in your app
 What is a database?

The database is like the unsung hero of the tech world. It quietly sits in the background, doing its thing, while most users don't know how it works or even that it exists. All they see is a nice-looking user interface that always seems to have their data ready. But without the database none of those apps and websites would be of any use.

So how exactly does it work? Imagine a huge spreadsheet that has hundreds, thousands or even millions of rows and columns, with each cell containing a piece of data. You can think of each row as representing a single entity, such as a customer or an order, and each column as representing a specific attribute of that entity, such as their name or order number.

In many ways, the comparison is not just a metaphor: a spreadsheet *is* a kind of database. But the type of database connected to a web application is designed to store data in a secure way and be incredibly efficient at finding and retrieving specific records even with complex queries.

That's why great applications are those who put a lot of work into the combination of working efficiently with data *and* great design. A social media app like Facebook or a video app like TikTok would not be very interesting if all they presented was a spreadsheet of likes and URLs to video clips; the data and design go hand in hand to create a success story.
 Bubble's database

[](https://youtu.be/z0L8vFsCwkk)

Setting up and managing a database is traditionally a demanding job that requires specific training like a degree in computer science and even additional education and certification.

One of Bubble's core strengths is its built-in database that's automatically set up when your app is created, removing the need for dedicated employees to operate it.

Bubble takes care of most of the database management for you:

- Creating the database when you first set up your app
   - Setting up and maintaining two separate databases: one for testing and one for live users
- Keeping it operational and maintaining uptime​
- ​Encrypting its content to store and transfer it securely
- Take point-in-time backups that can be recovered at any time
- Privacy Rules keeps user data securely protected, based on who is trying to access it
- Creating and maintaning user profiles with secure passwords
- Regular vulnerability testing

 Types of data

As you develop your Bubble application you'll find that you need to store data in different ways, and we split these into three categories:

> Dynamic data (the database)

> Dynamic data is information that the users of your app need to dynamically be able to create, read, edit, delete, search for and aggregate. This covers all kinds of different data that you and your users will find it useful to work with on an ongoing basis: stuff like social media posts, customer information, blog articles, eCommerce products and chat messages.

> Information like this is stored in the database.

> Article: [The database](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database)​

> Temporary data (custom states and URL parameters)

> Temporary data is information that your app needs to store while the program is running – in traditional programming you would call them variables. They can be used for all sorts of things: navigation, calculations, remember a list of things that the user selected, remembering user input that you don't need to store permanently – any kind of information that you only need while the app is open.

> Temporary data is stored in **Custom states** (a sort of variable connected to an element) or in **URL parameters** (information stored in the page's URL)

> Article series: [Temporary data](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/temporary-data) Article: [Custom states](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/temporary-data/custom-states) Article: [URL parameters](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/temporary-data/url-parameters)​

> Static data (Application texts and Option sets)

> Static data is information that you want to keep consistent or that's unlikely to change regularly. This could be a list of options like states, countries, colors, or categories, strings of text like headers, menu options, error messages or text translations and settings like membership type, gender or interests.

> Bubble offers two different ways of storing static data with very different uses:

> App texts (translations)

> App texts are static strings of text that you display around your app, such as headers, tooltips, explainer texts, menu options, page titles and metadata.

> App texts are different from Option Sets in that they are created specifically to hold strings that can be translated into different languages. This gives you an easy way to prepare your app to available to a global audience.

> Let's say you add the App text "Welcome to my app". You can then add translations of that string in other languages such as German and Hindi and Bubble will automatically use the translated text based on the user's preferences. You maintain full control over what languages you want to let your users pick and how they set their preferred language.

> App text *can* be used for translations, but they don't have to: you can also use it to have a simple way to manage all the static strings of text around your app in one place.

> App texts are meant for public information – they are not encrypted and should not contain any sensitive information.

> Option sets

> Option sets let you store any type of unchanging information like in the examples above. It can be single values like a text or number or a list of values that can be used in elements like checkboxes, radio boxes and dropdowns.

> Option Sets, as the name suggest, allows you to set up a set of options that you can manage in one place, making it easy to maintain and update as needed. They require that your app is deployed before updates are visible to your users, as opposed to dynamic database data that can be changed in real time.

> Option Sets are meant for public information – they are not encrypted and should not contain any sensitive information.

 The database

This section covers different aspects of how the Bubble database works

The database is the cornerstone of most applications. It handles all the *dynamic* data, meaning data that you and your users can create, change, view and delete as frequently as needed.

The database works in tandem with your app's design to give your users the combination of being able to work with complex data efficiently, without being burdened by the mechanics of how it actually happens under the hood. Most of your users don't know how it works and indeed don't even know that it's there – they just know that the information they stored in your app yesterday is still there today for them to interact with.

![app-db-example.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fj3rQVw5XrMVYunq6rhmv%2Fapp-db-example.jpeg?alt=media&token=23ce5729-778f-4287-91af-292058782a5e)

Your app's user interface is all your users will ever see while the database rests underneath the stage silently doing its job.
 What is a database?

When you hear the term *database*, you might imagine vast servers, intricate codes, and complex structures. But with Bubble, the idea of a database is made refreshingly simple and user-friendly.

At its core, a database is a structured collection of data. Think of it as a digital library, where instead of books, you have data entries, and instead of shelves, you have tables or, in Bubble’s terminology, *data types*. Each data type can have several fields that store specific kinds of information. For instance, a data type *User* might have fields such as *Name*, *Email*, and *Date of birth*.

Within Bubble, this database is visual and intuitive. Rather than writing SQL queries or scripts to manage the data, you interact with a clean, graphical interface. You can create new data types, add fields, or adjust relations between different data types with a few clicks. And while Bubble takes care of the heavy lifting in the background, ensuring that the data remains secure and retrievable, you can focus on designing the logic and flow of your application.

For those familiar with traditional databases, Bubble's approach simplifies many of the complexities involved. There's no need to stress about database schemas, SQL syntax, or indexing. Instead, Bubble handles these technical aspects, allowing creators to focus on the logic and design of their app, making the process of integrating and utilizing a database far less daunting.

The database comes with its own set of commands to create, manipulate and delete data.

​
 Communicating with the database

When you and your users interact with your Bubble app, two computers are involved:

- The device that the user is accessing the app from (such as a laptop or cell phone)
- Bubble's server (located in a server park)

Whenever an action is needed that involves the database, such as reading, writing or deleting data, that command is sent from the user's device to the server, where the job is completed and a confirmation and any requested information is sent back to the device.

![server-communication.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F6LY5c90SP79wmTiquzue%2Fserver-communication.jpeg?alt=media&token=ba07c52a-322b-406b-b700-a800c5c34eca)

As such, working with data in your app is an ongoing stream of communication between the user's device and the Bubble server. This doesn't just happen on page load, but continually as the user provides your app with actions and input. Even for a single user, small packets of data can be sent back and forth several times per second.

As the developer of the app, you can set it up to send all sorts of different commands to the server:

- Create things
- Make changes to and delete things
- Search for things and return the result as a list
- Find one specific Thing and return its content

Any data sent between the user's device and the server is encrypted at all times, ensuring that it stays private. Let's say a user provides input about himself such as name and date of birth: when that data is being sent to the Bubble server, it's encrypted and can't be read by anyone else. It's also encrypted during storage on the server itself.

> What is database encryption?

> Encryption is a method used to protect information by converting it into an unreadable format. This ensures that even if unauthorized individuals or systems would manage to access the database, they won't be able to comprehend the actual data unless they possess the appropriate decryption key or method.

> Imagine your database as a diary. Instead of writing your secrets in plain English, you decide to use a special code only you understand. If someone were to find and read your diary, they wouldn't understand its contents without knowing how to decode your special code. Database encryption works on a similar principle, but with algorithms and cryptographic keys.

> Bubble automatically ensures the database is encrypted at all times.

> Encryption during rest and transit

> The data in and sent from the database can be in two states:

> **Rest** means when the data is stored on the server's hard drive. In this state the data is encrypted using the industry standard AES-256 encryption.

> **Transit** means when the data is moving from the server to the user's device through the interoptic cables that make up the internet. During this state the data is encrypted with the TLS protocol, which ensures three important points:

- > The data has been encrypted, rendering it unreadable in case of interception by unauthorized parties.
- > The source of the data, i.e. the Bubble server, has been authenticated, which guarantees that the data originated from a verified source and not an imposter.
- > The data's integrity has been maintained throughout its transmission, ensuring that it has not been tampered with or altered in any way during transit
 Privacy rules

Privacy rules are rules that govern what users can access what data. It's the most important part of your database's security, and we strongly recommend that all apps that host any kind of private or sensitive data set up privacy rules to protect it.

 Data types and fields

In the next article in the series, we'll look into how you create custom data types, and populate them with fields to store relevant information.

 Bubble database terminology

| **Term**        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Constraint      | A filter applied to a search to narrow down the results. For example, retrieving all products with a price less than $50.                                                                                  |
| Data source     | Defines where the data in an expression or element comes from. This is often a specific search (*Do a search for*) or direct reference to a type of data in the database (such as *Parent group's thing*). |
| Data type       | Represents a category of data (e.g., User, Product, Order). Similar to a table in traditional databases.                                                                                                   |
| Do a search for | The data source that retrieves specific data from the database based on certain constraints.                                                                                                               |
| Field           | Attributes or properties within a Data Type (e.g., Email, Name, Price). Similar to columns in a table.                                                                                                     |
| List            | A collection of things. For instance, a user might have a list of favorite products. A field can be set up to store one thing or a list of things.                                                         |
| Privacy rule    | Criteria that determine how data can be searched for, modified, or viewed based on user roles or other conditions.                                                                                         |
| Repeating Group | A UI element in Bubble that displays a list of things from the database, allowing for dynamic rendering of data.                                                                                           |
| Thing           | An individual record or entry in the database.                                                                                                                                                             |
 Additional resources

> Technical information about the Bubble database

> **Server**

> The Bubble database is hosted on Amazon’s Relational Database Service (RDS) which is a part of Amazon Web Services. The database is encrypted using the industry standard AES-256 encryption.

> **Database technology**

> Bubble uses PostgreSQL – an open source database management system. In other words, we have not invented a new kind of database system, but use one that has been in development for decades and is thoroughly tested and audited for stability and security.

> This is one of the most widely used systems on the internet, and since it's based on the SQL standard (a very common database format), Bubble can communicate with other databases without worrying about compatibility.

> How the Bubble database is different from traditional databases

> Technically, Bubble uses the same technology as the majority of other web servers: SQL, and specifically PostgreSQL.

> Still, the way the database is visualized in the Bubble editor can be a bit confusing if you come from a traditional database background.

> The major difference is that Bubble **automates the use of primary and foreign keys.** When creating a relationship between two data types (tables), Bubble uses a custom data type field to represent a reference to another record in a different table.

> For example, let's say we have a "User" data type and a "Post" data type, and we want to create a relationship between them such that each post is associated with a user. In Bubble, we would create a field in the "Post" table with the data type "User", which would represent a reference to a user record in the "User" table.

> While Bubble doesn't expose the use of foreign keys to developers, database relationships still technically rely on them. The Unique ID field serves as the primary key for a record and is used to retrieve data, but this part of the process is hidden to make database setup and management easier for users without a database background.

> While you may have use for the foreign key in some select scenarios, you generally don't need to reference it in Bubble in the way that you may be used to in other environments.

 Data types

The database consists of different **data types** that you as the developer plan and set up. Data types are like containers that hold specific types of information and each data type is made up of **fields** where that information is stored.

For example, in a sports league management system, one data type might be used to hold information about teams, such as their name, coach, and roster of players. Another data type could be used to hold information about games, such as the date, location, and final score.

With our visual editor, you have complete freedom to structure, manage, and connect data types as you want.

Let's first have a look at how you create new data types:
 Creating data types

You can create as many data types as you need. To create one, follow the steps below:

![create-new-data-type@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FE1iXIAUD2hU0HWNY5QHN%2Fcreate-new-data-type%402x.png?alt=media&token=76906775-de6c-4f00-866e-3224457f4294)

In this example we have added two custom types already: Cart and Product. The *User* data type is built into Bubble.

- First, navigate to the **Data tab** in the Bubble editor
- Then, go to **Data types**
- In the field labelled *New type,* provide a **name**. Don't worry, you can change this at any later time.
- Click the **Create** button

The new data type will be added to the *Custom data types* list.
 Naming Data Types

Bubble lets you name your Data Types as you please, even using characters such as space. While you are free to name them as you please, it can be useful to follow a few guidelines:

- **Use unique names:** While Bubble does support duplicate names, giving your data types unique names makes it easier to identify the correct one. Keep in mind that this can affect Option sets as well, as Option sets and data types will often show up in the same lists.
- **Use singular names:** Bubble automatically pluralizes names. For example, if you name your data type *Event*, Bubble will automatically refer to it as Events whenever it's appropriate

> Video lessons

- > ​[Naming your data types and fields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XueeVCReuI8)​
 Fields

Each data type consist of **fields** that hold different kinds of information. These fields are formatted in specific ways and can only hold the type of information that they are set up to contain.

To illustrate, think of a phone book: a *Contact* has different fields for name, date of birth and email address and the format of these fields remains constant: name and email address will always contain text and date of birth will always contain a date.

The field is where the information saved to a data type is actually stored.

Bubble has the following built-in field types:

- **text** A string a text that can contain any kind of character
- **number** A numerical value, which can be a whole number or a decimal
- **numeric range** A range consisting of a low and a high value, such as 5-10
- **date** Contains a date and time
- **date range** A range of dates, such as 1/1/1970 - 1/15/1970
- **date interval** A Date interval quantifies the difference between two dates. It/s the number of days/hours/minutes/etc between them
- **yes / no** A value that can be true or false (sometimes called a boolean)
- **file** The URL of a file
- **image** The URL of an image file
- **geographic address** A Google Maps formatted address
- **Data type** Any data type that you can set up can also be a field type

This is where the flexibility of Bubble's database becomes apparent: by creating custom data types and populating those types with custom fields, we can set up a structure for almost any thinkable scenario.

The last item on the list above is particularly significant. That's because every data type we create can be used to format a field in a different data type, which is how we interconnect them.

Storing a list of values

Each field can also be set up to store a *list* of values. For example, if you want to store more than one text value you can check the box labelled *This field is a list (multiple entries).* This lets you add new values that make up a list, such as *Red, Blue, Green, Yellow*.

![create-new-field-list@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FVoHTfisdBxYrw50Son4F%2Fcreate-new-field-list%402x.png?alt=media&token=1fbf12e7-0851-4e14-b240-f5e5bee6b540)

Checking the option above lets you store a list of values instead of a single value.

Any type of field can contain lists, including custom data types. This way you can reference multiple things, such as the tags connected to a blog post or the products in a cart.

Video lessons

- ​[How to create a field as a list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2xJ_RhAfMk)​
 Built-in fields

In addition to the fields that you choose to add to a data type, Bubble will also set up the fields below:
 Unique ID

The Unique ID is a 32-character alphanumeric string that identifies a specific thing in your database. The Unique ID (sometimes shortened to UID) is generated automatically when the thing is created and cannot be edited.

A Unique ID looks like the example below:

1651238619517x600101118159717500
 Date created and Date modified

These two fields are also automatically populated by Bubble and are stored in the *date* format. The Date created field never changes, and the Date modified field automatically updates any time any changes are made to the Thing.
 Slug

The slug field lets you set up a user-friendly and search engine optimized URL for the thing. When you load data onto a page, you can instruct Bubble to use this string of text as the last part of the page's URL, to give each thing a unique URL.

For example, if the name of a Product is "A Beginner's Guide to Bubble," the corresponding slug might be "a-beginners-guide-to-bubble". The slug is then appended to the page URL such as:

[https://www.myapp.com/products/la-beginners-guide-to-bubble](https://www.myapp.com/products/la-beginners-guide-to-bubble)

This lets you set up user-friendly and search engine optimized URLs for different data types such as articles, blog posts, products, and other types of content.

Changing the slug on a thing cannot be done with the *Make changes to a thing* action, but needs to be done with the *Set a thing's slug* action.
 Custom field types

Any data type that you create can also be used as a field type. For example, say you have a data type called **Cart**, and to this cart you should be able to add **Products.** You can set up a field on the Cart data type, check *This field is a list* and choose the Product data type as Field type:

For instance, we can use a data type for a shopping cart to connect it to a data type for a user. By doing that, we can determine who the owner of that particular cart is.

- > [How to add a data type as a custom field](https://youtu.be/4txlG9nwr1E)
 Creating fields

After you have created your data type, you can set up the fields you need:

![create-field.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FmLLQxYdlWvOPbUxqFRXO%2Fcreate-field.png?alt=media&token=bc665af6-0b5b-4dd6-9753-184971b051d4)

Click the image to see a bigger version

- First, select the data type on which you want to create a new field (Cart)
- Click the *Create a new field* button at the bottom of the existing fields
- Give the field a fitting name
- Choose the type of data you want to store in that field from the list above or from your existing data types. In this example we have selected *User* since we want the owner of the Cart to be a registered user
- Pick whether the field should contain a *list* of the selected data or a single item. In this case we want each cart to just have one owner, so we don't check the box.

Let's look at some examples of how varying app types may require different data types:
 Examples
 Data types

We'll go over three different examples to see how you can set up data types that cater to different applications. Note that the examples aren't intended to be a blueprint or the best practice for these categories. Instead, they serve to demonstrate the versatility of data types in various scenarios.
 Example 1: eCommerce store

In an eCommerce store, we might need three data types to handle basic functionality. We want *Users* to be able to add *Products* to a *Cart:*

| **Product** | **Cart** | **User (built in)** |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------- |
 Example 2: Sports league management app

Managing a sports league could require a bit more complicated setup: a league consists of different *Clubs,* that each have a few *Teams* with *Players*. The players play *Games.* The *Player* data type is actually the built-in *User* data type. Since Bubble already provides this data type that allows users to log in and use the app, it makes sense to use it. Keep in mind that the *User* data type cannot be renamed. Therefore, we're simply clarifying that it's referred to as a *Player* in this particular context.

| **League** | **Club** | **Team** | **Game** | **Player (user - built in)** |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
 Example 3: Blog

A blog can have a very simple setup consisting of blog posts, tags that let you search for posts of a specific type and authors. Again, the *Author* type is the *User* type but to better convey its intended purpose, it's referred to as "Author"

| **Blog post** | **Tags** | **Author (user - built in)** |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
 Adding the fields
 Example 1: eCommerce store

| **Product**                                                          | **Cart**                                    | **User (built in)** |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Name (text)<br>Description (text)<br>Image (image)<br>Price (number) | Owner (user)<br>Products (list of Products) | Name                |
 Example 2: Sports league management app

In our Sports league management app we can really see how data types are referenced downward in the hierarchy: a Player is a part of a Team, which is a part of a Club, which is a part of a League.

| **League**  | **Club**                    | **Team**                   | **Player (user - built in)**            |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Name (text) | Name (text) League (League) | Name (text)<br>Club (Club) | Name<br>Email (built-in)<br>Team (Team) |
 Example 3: Blog

On our blog website we can return to a simpler structure. We have the blog posts, on which we need to store 1) the header and post content, both texts, 2) The User who wrote it (the author) and the list of Tags (such as *Politics* and *Tech).*

| **Blog post**                                                        | **Tag** | **Author (user - built in)** |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| Header (text)<br>Post (text)<br>Author (User)<br>Tags (list of Tags) | Name    | Name<br>Email (built-in)     |

As we've explored, setting up custom data types and fields lets you adapt your database to suit your project. In simple terms, data types are the containers that define the type of data you want to manage, while fields contain the various types of information stored within that data type.

If we were working on a phone book, the data type would be *Contact* and the fields would *Name, Email address* and *Phone number*.

 Creating, saving and deleting data

This article covers how to work with the data in your database by creating, changing and deleting things

Bubble comes with a range of different ways to work with the data in the database to:

- Create new things​
- Make changes to existing things
- Deleting things

Manipulating data in the database is done in three different ways:

- You can set up **workflows** that trigger on specific events, such as the user clicking a *Save changes* button
- You can use **auto-binding** to save changes in the database every time the user provides some input to an input field​
- You can edit data directly in the database using the **database editor****.** This option is only available to users who have that access in the Bubble editor

Workflows

A workflow is a collection of actions that run in sequence whenever an *event* happens. You can choose between many different types of events, such as a button click, an input field being updated or when a specific condition is true.

![workflow-schema.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FixsfXqyGYp0EYeqkGX3u%2Fworkflow-schema.jpeg?alt=media&token=31eb1a55-017c-44c0-bcca-c09cf4608c44)

Actions

There are few different actions that make changes to the database. You can click the links below to see the core reference entry for that action:

- ​[Create a new thing](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/data-thingcreate-a-new-thing...): creates a new record of a specific data type and optionally saves information in the fields of that data type
- ​[Make changes to a thing](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/data-thingmake-changes-to-thing...): saves new information to a thing, replacing whatever was in the field before
   - ​[Make changes to a list of things](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/data-thingmake-changes-to-a-list-of-things...): same as above, but works on multiple things at once.
- ​[Make changes to the current user](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/accounmake-changes-to-current-user): the same as above, but works directly on the user that started the workflow
- ​[Delete a thing](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/data-thingdelete-thing...): deletes a thing from the database
   - ​[Delete a list of things](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/data-thingdelete-a-list-of-things...): same as above, but for multiple records
- ​[Copy a list of things](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/data-thingdelete-a-list-of-things...): creates an identical copy of a list of existing thing with a new unique ID and updated *Created date* and *Modified date* fields. You can copy up to 50 things in one operation.

By combining these actions in various ways, you can work with new and existing data in a flexible manner, and even include additional actions that are related or unrelated to the database.

Example

Let's say you have set up a form that lets a user edit their own profile. In that case we would have some different input fields that let the user provide information. We could then have a button that triggers the workflow:

![edit-user.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FQmnsJCalkK8pHRD7EDiH%2Fedit-user.jpg?alt=media&token=0f92048d-e83e-4544-ae15-6e160f1250f5)

In this example, we have a list of input fields where the user can provide some information and then click the button element to save those changes. Click the image to see a bigger version.

The setup above would mean that no changes are saved to the database until the user actually clicks the button.

Note that some information, like email and password, has to be changed using a different action from the *Make changes to thing.* Because of the sensitive nature of user credentials, it's necessary to handle them differently to ensure their security and protect user privacy. Article: [User accounts](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/user-accounts)​

![save-changes-to-user-workflow.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FnikOD0uDFFa1RFlP68Wp%2Fsave-changes-to-user-workflow.png?alt=media&token=138a9537-7a91-426f-8a27-b5248c082f85)

Here we are combining the *An element is clicked* event to trigger the *Make changes to the current user* action. Together these two steps make up the workflow.

Using workflows let you set up additional actions after the first one to perform other relevant tasks. For example, we could use the *Alert* element to display a message that the operation was successful:

![show-alert-message.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FkKmDGfIhgiEvhczBw02E%2Fshow-alert-message.png?alt=media&token=7ed801fd-68b9-4d30-9420-dc888b962999)

In this example we're setting up an additional step to show a message to our users that the changes have been saved. Note that there needs to be an *Alert* element on the page for this action to become available.

As we can see in this example, workflows are useful when you want the user to be able to decide *when* to save the changes, and if you need to chain more than one action in the workflow.

Auto-binding

Auto-binding means to bind an input element to a specific field on a data type. When this is set up, Bubble will automatically save any changes made in that element to the database. This means that you don't need to set up any actions to make the changes.

Auto-binding is connected to a field, meaning that the data format of the input element and the data field must match: for example, a field containing a date must be connected to an input element that expects a date from the user.

Also, auto-binding will only work if the parent of the input element has a data type loaded into it and it cannot create new things: only write to things that already exists.

![auto-bind-bubble@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F6jSKpee9Hu2xjI0Dhcsw%2Fauto-bind-bubble%402x.png?alt=media&token=1da77b7e-6f84-44ab-986b-445e8c5a28c4)

Auto-binding is set up in the element property inspector. By checking the *Enable auto-binding on parent element's thing* you can select what field to modify and optionally to show an alert each time the operation is succssful.

In the example above we have set up a text input element that automatically saves the input to the field *Name* on the user. The user is loaded into the parent, which either a container element or the page itself.

The data is saved whenever the element loses focus, meaning that the user has clicked or tabbed away from the input field. Bubble will display the loading bar for a brief time to show the user that the data is being saved.

**Note:** Auto-binding on an input will run immediately, rather than waiting for the "next step" when using the step-by-step feature in the debugger.

Showing an alert on success

When auto-binding is active you can show an alert to notify the user that it was successful. To use this feature, you need to first place an alert element on the page. Checking the *Show an alert on success* lets you select which Alert element to use and what message to show.

![changes-saved-alert@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FlwuaAeH9YgadHdj68Urg%2Fchanges-saved-alert%402x.png?alt=media&token=ce9338ce-025b-40d6-89b1-1162cdf551c0)

In the screenshot above you see we have created an alert element and checked the *Position the alert at the top* box to make sure it's displayed as a full-width bar at the top of the page.

![aut-bind-alert@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FjRoHlNKaDVjV4ulSXHcb%2Faut-bind-alert%402x.png?alt=media&token=63f2a261-38ba-4e9b-9ffc-d25b22028026)

On the input that has auto-binding activated we pick the alert element we just created. We also created a custom alert message that coincides with the field that was changed.

Comparing workflows and auto-binding

There are some key differences when choosing to work with workflows or auto-binding:

UX

The first is simply how it affects the user experience. In some forms it makes sense to let users review their information and not save anything until they click a button. In other cases it's more efficient to save the information as soon as the field has been edited. It's up to you as the developer to decide what's best in each case.

Security

Bubble handles security on actions and auto-bind a bit differently:

Workflows

Workflows are not affected by privacy rules and need to have their own conditional expressions set up to control who can do what. As an example, in the action below we have set up an expression that dictates that a user can only edit a profile if it's his own:

![edit-user-conditional-expression@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F4HnZTCUpjzQN1QhIzFcx%2Fedit-user-conditional-expression%402x.png?alt=media&token=8b7b5ef3-13d8-42a7-ae0f-4e248ba675e4)

The expression above will check that the user being edited is the current user. This ensure that users can only save changes to their own profile.

Auto-binding

Auto-binding has a dedicated privacy rule which dictates under what circumstances changes to the field will be saved. The field will still be editable, but when it loses focus it will generate an error message if the privacy rules doesn't allow for the user to save changes via auto-binding.

![privacy-rules-auto-binding@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FTdHAyAWRksAbOnHGU5HY%2Fprivacy-rules-auto-binding%402x.png?alt=media&token=ac5c6216-577e-4c01-b1f6-7953cb9108f0)

In the screenshot above we have set up a privacy rule that allows the *Name* field to be edited *if* the user being edited is the same as the current user. If someone else tries to edit this user with auto-binding, it will generate an error message.

Performance

Workflows and auto-bind also has a slight difference in how they behave from a performance perspective:

- **Workflows** sends all the changes that need to be made in one big chunk to the server. This means you will have *fewer* slowdowns, but the one you have may be longer, depending on how much data is transferred
- **Auto-binding** sends the updated information to the server immediately when a field is edited. This means you will have more, but possibly shorter data transfers

There's no right or wrong answer to what the right approach is. Also, it's important to note that the difference can be very small, often negligible. While the difference *is* there, it's important to weigh the pros and cons in terms of the total user experience to decide what method is best.

The database editor

Bubble also lets you edit data directly in the built-in database editor. This works both for the Development database and the Live database.

You access the database editor by going to the *Data – App data* tab and selecting the data type you want to edit. You can search for specific things and edit them by clicking the edit icon.

![bubble-database-editor@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FohUkibHa7LfE8xaKwMsG%2Fbubble-database-editor%402x.png?alt=media&token=9f72f104-4683-441e-9553-40e7a7e58fa3)

Clicking the pencil icon next to a thing lets you make changes to it.

Editing directly in the database is useful when you need to make a quick update, but as a long-term solution we recommend setting up your own forms to edit data.

FAQ

If I use auto-binding, can I still run additional actions when something is saved?

Yes. You can set up a workflow using the *An input's value has changed* event and place additional actions there. It's worth noting that the auto-bind operation may or may not have finished in time for the action to register the change. In other words, if any of the actions in that workflow rely on the data having been saved to the database, you may want to save it in a workflow instead of auto-binding. That way you can ensure that the process has completed by using the *Result of step X* data source.

Can I create new things with auto-bind?

Auto-bind only works on existing things, and cannot create new ones. If you try to write something in a container that has no data loaded, the operation will fail without showing any errors.

 Finding data

This section covers how to search for data using constraints

This section takes a long-form look at how searches in Bubble work. To see the the more concise and technical complete list of settings, constraints and operators, you can check out our [core reference entry on searches](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/search).

Having added and updated data in our database, we'll also need a way search for that data and display it around our app.

Finding data

Whenever you need to find some data in the database, you can perform a search using the *Do a search for* data source. This lets you set up a dynamic query to the database with specific constraints, and Bubble returns all things of that data type that match the constraints. You can only search for one data type at a time, such as *Users.*

Let's say you want to search for all users who have the name John. We can set up the *Do a search for* function like the example below.

Data sources like *Do a search for* are one of the building blocks in **dynamic expressions.** To read more about how to work with expressions, check out our dedicated article on the subject: Article: [Dynamic expressions](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/dynamic-expressions)​

First, we set the Type of content to *User* and in the *Data source* dropdown we pick *Do a search for:*

![do-a-search-for-dropdown@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FvkYgDQFKnMgjjYfc7ToM%2Fdo-a-search-for-dropdown%402x.png?alt=media&token=3f31434a-2a2f-4e23-948a-b8b65118a14e)

Then we set up a *constraint* which instructs Bubble to only return users that have the name John. The result will always be a list, even if it contains just one thing.

![do-a-search-for-users@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FmczOH9Vx3GS4eCWaWIEH%2Fdo-a-search-for-users%402x.png?alt=media&token=e747aa11-bc32-4b1a-802a-f05d61f0bb07)

In this example we are searching for users named John.

This is the basic way that database queries work: we tell Bubble what kind of data to search for, and then provide one or more constraints that each thing in the returned list needs to match. We can use this logic to find data in all sorts of scenarios:

- To display the results on a screen
- As part of a workflow (for example if we want to make changes to one or more things)
- As part of a conditional expression​

In the example above, we used a static value as a constraint: the name John. We can also set this up as a *dynamic* value. For example, we could change the condition to ask for the value of an input field instead. This would let your users type in a name and search the database for users that match:

![dynamic-search-constraint@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FRBVMxxSi3Hvuc76Ez2yo%2Fdynamic-search-constraint%402x.png?alt=media&token=14d2dc10-0297-4ccc-9df9-5c14c4348961)

In this example we are searching for a dynamic value from an input field called *Input search by name*. By referring to that value as a search, we can let our users specify what to search for.

Searches performed with the *Do a search for* data source are synchronised with the database in real-time. This means that any changes happening in the database, even if made by another user, will be immediately visible in your app.

Sorting the results

Sometimes you'll want to sort the result in a specific way, such as showing users in alphabetical order or tasks by their priority or deadline. This can be used to display the records in a list, or it can be used to find a specific record. For example, if you want to load the *last* user that was created in your database, you can sort the list by creation date and isolate the newest user with the *first item* or *last item* operator (depending on the sorting order).

You can set the sort order when you perform a search.

![sort-dat@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FnCPwLRXKAUuigNFl9aBB%2Fsort-dat%402x.png?alt=media&token=74c28c86-b46e-4d97-a5f8-7b07ebbe57ea)

In this screenshot we are sorting users by their name.

In some cases you will be referring to a list that's *not* loaded from a search, or where for some reason you need to apply the sorting *after* another operator in the expression. In that case you can use the *sorted* operator.

![sort-users-operator@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F9cMY1dbYRaIEXM9JmieK%2Fsort-users-operator%402x.png?alt=media&token=81499c97-55f0-452b-8a11-0d5516a87dce)

In this example we are using another repeating group as the data source and then applying sorting on that list.

The difference between a *list* and a single thing

Bubble has two ways of handling database records: as single items or as a list. It's important to understand this distinction, because the two are treated differently. For example, when you load data into container elements, a [*group*](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers/groups) element will expect a single thing, while a [*repeating group*](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers/repeating-groups) will expect a list of things.

Whenever you perform a search, the result will be a list – even if it only returns one thing (meaning it's a list with a count of one, but still a list).

Loading a single record from a list

Whenever you set up a data source that returns a list, such as *Do a search for*, Bubble elements and expression operators that expect a *single* item will return an error in the issue tracker. In cases like this, you will need to instruct Bubble to load *one* of the records in the list. You do this by adding another operator in the data source expression:

- **First item** will return the first item in the list. What item that will be depends on how the list is sorted. The default sorting is by creation date.
- **Last item** will return the last item in the list. What item that will be depends on how the list is sorted. The default sorting is by creation date.
- **Random item** will return a pseudorandom item from the list.
- **Item:** will return a single item as specified by its index number in the list. This operator requires you to also define a number, such as *Item 5*.

By combining search constraints with the *first item* operator you can often reach the exact thing you were looking for. For example, you could search for *users* and use the Email field as a constraint. Since emails are unique, you can be sure to find the right record by providing the email address of an existing user. If you then apply the *first item* to the list of results, you will have turned the list into a single thing.

Turning a single record into a list

Sometimes you'll need to go the other way and turn a single item into a list, even if that list still only contains the one record. To do this, use the *Converted to list* operator.

![converted-to-list-operator@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FjJwbzn0m1bvyxXZzZxzl%2Fconverted-to-list-operator%402x.png?alt=media&token=bc7d149c-8758-4b94-a1e6-39ddfa6c6476)

In this example we are taking the *User* loaded into a group called *Group User* and turning it into a list. The list will still contain just one record, but Bubble will treat it as a last. In the example this makes it a valid data source for a repeating group.

Other data sources

Searching for data in the database with *Do a search for* is one way of finding data.

| **Data source**        | **Description**                                                                     | **Returns**                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Do a search for        | Searches the database using constraints.                                            | A list of things                                |
| Current user           | The user currently using the app                                                    | One thing                                       |
| Current page thing     | The database record currently loaded onto the page using the *Go to page* action.   | One thing                                       |
| Get data from page URL | Getting a thing from a URL parameter that contains a unique ID.                     | One thing                                       |
| Things's X             | Getting a thing from a field saved on another thing, such as Current User's Company | A list or a single item, depending on the field |

 Displaying data

This section covers how to display data from the database in your app

After your users submit information which becomes data, you can use page elements to display it.

Container elements don't *display* the data per se, but load the data so that all of its child elements can easily reference it. This lets you easily load a thing into a container, and then use that as a data source to display and let users make changes to the data.

Things are displayed either as a single instance (for example viewing the current user) or a list of things (such as a list of products, contacts or tasks). The info-boxes below provide more information about these two scenarios:

Displaying a single thing in a container

Displaying multiple things in a list

Displaying data using expressions

To display data in an element such as a text, we need to set up an expression that tells Bubble what data we want to display. The expression consists of a *data source* and optionally one or more *operators* that further instructs Bubble what to do with the data. In the example below, we're using *Do a search for* as the data source and then adding the *first item* operator to load the first entry in the list of results that the search returns:

![group-data-source-product@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FWvXESiuTj5SX8Bs29LHm%2Fgroup-data-source-product%402x.png?alt=media&token=de24e97a-ce2d-481a-a948-b510d2c81dbd)

This loads the Product into the container element, in this case a group, but doesn't actually show anything to the user. To show some information, such as the name of the Product, we'll need to add another element inside of that group. We can then set up an expression on that element that refers to the thing loaded into the parent element:

![text-element-product-name@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FXuYXdzLhvkWnPnu8d4aN%2Ftext-element-product-name%402x.png?alt=media&token=f43cf619-3e3f-4d55-ac1b-6671ea7bf702)

The *Parent group's product* is the data source in this expression, and the *Name* is the operator that tells Bubble which field on the Product data type we want to display.

We could also set up the entire expression on the text element itself: *Do a search for Products:first item's Name* – but it would be cumbersome to do that for every element where we want to refer to that product.

By setting up a parent container and loading the data into it we speed things up and make sure that all elements inside refer to the same database thing.

The same logic can be applied to other things than text. We could for example set up an image element and load the correct Product image by again referring to the parent group's thing and the custom field *Image.*

![product-image@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FMBiAgI7MSDOo2p70QBFI%2Fproduct-image%402x.png?alt=media&token=878d434f-c7f3-4e89-a709-27a397d1a234)

In this example we are fetching an image URL from the database instead of text. The field on the data type is of type *image.*

By combining different element types and fields saved on a data type we can design our app to show info from the database in a way that our users hopefully find appealing.

![product-cards@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FHhiFuyaLpL3ieQDJNRG1%2Fproduct-cards%402x.png?alt=media&token=65e8eaa3-27e0-4f68-b0d3-c2ab69197a05)

In this example we are pulling the name, description, price and image for two different products from the database.

Displaying data using auto-bind

Auto-bind is used to automatically save changes to a thing whenever an input field changes, but it alse serves another purpose: it automatically loads the *existing* data into the field to which it's assigned. Let's say we didn't just want to display the name of the Product, we wanted users to be able to edit it.

By assigning a field that the element is auto-bound to, Bubble will automatically load any existing data from that field when the page is loaded:

![auto-bind-load-data@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FsiKX6rbfL3ZKgC4YIqoc%2Fauto-bind-load-data%402x.png?alt=media&token=232f9ec6-269e-46be-9b4c-fd0c051b8afe)

By auto-binding the input element to the *Name* field on the Product, Bubble automatically loads any existing data into that field when the page loads.

 Protecting data with privacy rules

This section covers how to use privacy rules to protect private data

This section takes a long-form look at what privacy rules are. To see the more concise and technical documentation you can check out our [core reference entry](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/privacy).

Privacy rules are an essential part of your app's security. Any database data that is private or sensitive needs to be protected with Privacy Rules to be considered secure.

Always stay on top of your app's Privacy rules to let your users safely entrust their data to your app.

Privacy rules are conditions that you set up on each data type in order to protect the data from being viewed and edited by unauthorized users.

What are Privacy rules?

All the data that you store in the database is hosted on a server. Privacy rules are rules that instruct the server to only send data to the browser or write to the database if certain conditions are met.

For example, we could allow our Products to only be viewable by people who are logged in. The Privacy Rule in humanly readable terms would be:

Only return the data if the current user is logged in

The logic in this case would be that we *ask* the server for some information by using a data source such as *Do a search for* and an operator like *Name* to show a Product name. If the privacy rule above is active, Bubble will *only* return the data if the query came from a user that is logged in.

The reason this is so essential to app security is that it's stopped on the *server-side*, and the data remains in an encrypted state in the database instead of being sent to the browser where it could be viewed.

As illustrated above, the privacy rules make up a sort of firewall for your data – every request to the database goes through a process of authentication and authorization before it's completed or rejected.

Client-side data

Before we explore privacy rules, it's important to understand that all data that reaches your user's device is by definition no longer secure. As a developer, you need to be aware that the as long as the data has been downloaded to the user's device – even if it's not displayed anywhere in your app – the user of that device can access it by looking at the data traffic being sent to and from the Bubble server.

This is fairly technical subject – suffice it to say that the only way data remains truly inaccessible is ensure it is not sent from the server in the first place. And privacy rules are the way to do that.

It's also important to stress that in most cases, we *want* the data to reach the device. If not, we wouldn't be able to work with data at all. The important task is to ensure that only the intended information is sent and no unauthorized data.

In an eCommerce store we would likely find data in the database that has different security requirements:

- All **Products** should be viewable by anyone (if not, no one will be able to buy anything)
- All **Shopping carts** should only be viewable by the user who created it (to keep the user's purchase history private)

The Products are known as *public data* and the Shopping cart is *private data.*
 How privacy rules work

[](https://youtu.be/1-meIeBUXPY)

Using the Bubble API introduces some new settings in the Privacy Rule tab. You can read more about those special settings in the article below.

Article: [Data API Privacy Rules](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-data-api/data-api-privacy-rules)​

Article: [Workflow API Privacy Rules](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/workflow-api-privacy-rules)​

Bubble features a privacy rule editor that lets you control the privacy settings on all your data types in one central place. You access this by going to the *Data* tab and then clicking *Privacy*.

Privacy rules protect your data types in the following ways:

- You can stop specific **fields** from being viewed
- You can stop the data type from being **found with** ***Do a search for***
- You can stop users from viewing **uploaded files**
- You can stop users from making changes with **auto-binding**

**Caution:** Privacy rules do not update automatically on the page if the privacy rules impacting a user change while the user is on that page.

For example, if a user has a page open where they can see a Thing, then they click a button on that page that changes which privacy rules apply to them such that they can no longer see that Thing, this new privacy rule outcome will *not* reflect on the page until the page is refreshed.

Managing the security of **private files** requires configuring specific settings within both the Privacy Rules and the element responsible for uploading the file.

You can learn more about this in our dedicated guide below:

- Article: [Files](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/files)​
- Article section: [Uploading private files](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/fileuploading-private-files)​

Privacy rules are built using two pieces of information:

- What are the attributes of the database thing
- What are the attributes of the current user

By combining the attributes of these two, we can flexibly set up rules that determine **who** the user is and **what** the user is trying to access. Let's look at another rule written out as a sentence to illustrate:

Only return the data if the thing's Creator is the current user

Here we are involving both the *thing* in question and the *current user*. If the current user and the creator of the thing is the same, then Bubble will return the data. If they are not, the data stays securely on the server.

Privacy rule settings

Each privacy rule consists of different settings, and the easiest way to understand how they work is to simply read them from left to right like you would an English sentence:

![privacy-rule-explanation@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F4Edrv0zjXzG5LMf39OT8%2Fprivacy-rule-explanation%402x.png?alt=media&token=363dbabf-c5da-40e5-ae3d-cbe336b0292a)

Instead of viewing at a complex dashboard with different settings, it can be useful to simply read it out from left to right as a sentence.

The sentence above says "*When the current user is logged in, users who match this rule can view all fields*". Since we are working on the data type Product (visible in the header of the form), we could extend that sentence to "When the current user is logged in, users who match this rule can view all fields on the product".

The settings and their labels are meant to be taken literally. For example, *View all fields* means **View** all fields – it does not stop making *changes* to the field in a workflow. Likewise, *Find this in searches* applies to *Do a search for* specifically – but the record can still be referenced in other ways.

We recommend playing around with the settings and viewing the results on a page to learn how they affect what users can see and do.

Privacy rules and workflows

Do Privacy rules affect your app's workflows? The answer is *yes and no*.

- *View all fields* does not stop you from *Making changes to a thing* and updating that field in a workflow. However, it *can* stop you from correctly checking a condition if the current user is unable to view the field on which the condition is based
- *Do a search for* does not stop you from making changes to a thing, but it can stop you from getting the search results that you want in a workflow. In other words, if you are using the *Do a search for* data source in a workflow, the search will only return the data that the current user has access to.
- *Allow auto-binding* stops the user from making changes through auto-bound elements – but it does not stop them from making those same changes in a workflow.

There are two important lessons we can take in:

- You need to view the workflow as being *run by the current user* – the same restrictions will apply to the workflow as in any other scenario in your app
- To protect workflows from performing tasks you don't want it to, you'll need to use *conditional expressions* in the *Only when* field on the workflow or specific action

Can I override privacy rules in a workflow?

Sometimes you'll have a need to override privacy rules when a user takes a specific action. For example:

- User 1 does not have permission to search for any other users
- When User 1 runs a specific action, you may need to perform a search for all other users to make a change

In other words, you need to override the Privacy Rule that stops User 1 from searching for other users. This is done by using an API Workflow and checking *Ignore privacy rules when running the workflow.*

This lets you run workflows that perform an important task with full access to data, without compromising your security by opening up the access for the current user. The operation is performed purely server-side, meaning that your users cannot see it or even know that it's running.

![override-privacy-rules@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FJc5h7uhY2HfdXOy1r7au%2Foverride-privacy-rules%402x.png?alt=media&token=92172c04-079b-4b18-a86a-ac37b018a508)

Using an API Workflow, we can override Privacy Rules to get access to data that the current user is prohibited from seeing. It all happens securely on Bubble's server and never reaches the current user's device

Examples

Example 1: Shopping cart

First, we'll set up the example from earlier, but expand on it a little bit. We have a custom data type called Shopping Cart. This type should only be found in searches and viewable by the person who created it. But wait: if no one else can see the order, how are we to deliver the product?

Someone else needs to be able to see it, but it must be restricted. We'll set up a custom field on each user called *Admin* (yes/no), which grants access to see anyone's cart. On the cart, we can use the already existing and automatically populated *Created by* field.

The User should look like this:

![admin-user.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FKmNcmb1GKLhdXsvM53Dd%2Fadmin-user.png?alt=media&token=89317426-4e5f-4678-b350-10548c9c544e)

We set up a simple yes/no field to separate admin users from regular users. Note that we have set the default value to *no* to make sure that new users are *not* an admin by default.

This setup requires that we set up three privacy rules:

- The first gives access to search for and view fields on the cart *if* you are the one who created it
- The second gives access to search for and view fields on the cart *if* your admin field is set to *yes*
- The third is the automatically generated *Everyone else* rule: this states that everyone else should have *no access*

![privacy-rules.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FAhBdFhEEmsyKMbWt9rK0%2Fprivacy-rules.png?alt=media&token=a5d28c93-8503-410c-b615-697743774ec9)

These three simple rules is all we need in this scenario.

Pay especially close attention to the *bottom* rule, marked in red. This is the one that determines what happens to *everyone else*. We've unchecked all the boxes in this example, making sure that *only* admins and cart owners get access.

A good way to think about privacy rules is that *the most generous rule –* the one that gives the broadest access – will always override any other rules you set up.

> With privacy rules, you don't *prohibit access,* you **grant it.** Following that logic, our two top rules are *granting* access to the cart 1) if you are the cart's creator, or 2) if you are an admin, as specificed by the *Admin* yes/no field.

Example 2: Sharing tasks

In this example, we'll look into how properties on the data type to which the privacy rules are applied can further grant access under certain circumstances.

Let's imagine we have a task management app, where access to tasks follow two simple rules:

- The creator of the task has full access to their tasks
- The creator can invite other users into a specific task, granting them access

In that case, we need some way to determine whether a user has been invited to a specific task. Keep in mind, we want to add that permission only to certain tasks, not all of them.

We can solve this by adding a new custom field on the Task data type that contains a list of all Users who have been invited to it. The database structure can look like this:

![task-invite-users.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FZx1xngekYDd7RB7dINm7%2Ftask-invite-users.png?alt=media&token=e9ac1313-2809-43ee-b495-e7bca6ad89bc)

Whenever we want to give someone access to the Task, we add their name to the list using workflow:

![add-user-to-task.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FDz7BFeoOpBRSbMU9MPwV%2Fadd-user-to-task.png?alt=media&token=39dca408-fd3a-4a4d-a1e1-9a40c1f4fefd)

Since the *Invited users* field is set to be a **list**, Bubble lets us use the *add* function that will add that single user to the list of Invited Users (if we wanted to add a list of users we would use the *add list* function).

Now, to set up our privacy rule, we will again need three rules:

- The first states that if the current user is the Creator of the task, you should have access
- The second states that if the current user is in the list of invited users, you should have access
- The third (*everyone else*) states that no one else should have access

In the privacy rule editor it will look like this:

![invited-users-task@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FT44jsbBVrqD0mv3rWsXJ%2Finvited-users-task%402x.png?alt=media&token=51663aca-46f9-46ba-9f3a-060f783886e7)

Again we can see that the two rules **grant** access under special circumstances, while the bottom does **not** grant the permission to everyone else.

Ending notes

Privacy rules are the most important safeguard you have to protect your user's data, and we strongly encourage that you get to know them well and make a habit of setting up data to be secure from day one. Privacy Rules act on the server-side, making it impossible for data to be stolen, tampered with or accidentally leaked, since the information never leaves the server

Bubble has strong security features in place, but we don't enforce them. It's up to you as the developer of the app to use them in the right way to make sure your user's private data stays private.

----
 The database editor

This section covers Bubble's built-in database editor that lets you manage all the data in your app from one central place

Bubble comes with a built-in database editor. The App Data section in the Data Tab shows the application database, i.e., the actual data that you or your users have entered. It also has a few key tools to help you manage your data.

Note that Live and Development have different databases.

Database views

The App Data tab is structured around the concept of database views, that are listed on the left side of the screen. A database view is a combination of three things:

- The fields that are shown in the view (the columns in the table).
- A sorting order.
- Some optional search constraints to filter out some entries.

By default, Bubble adds a view for each data type that is defined in your application. They will show all entries (things) for each type, sorted by creation date.

When you click on the pen icon on the right of the list, you can modify the view. If it's a default view, a new view will be created and will be modified. You can then add/remove constraints. When a view is selected, the table will update and show things that meet the constraints (if any).

Run as

When you are debugging your app, it can be useful to run your application as a specific user and see exactly what the user experience is for that user. When looking at the *User* data type in the database editor, each row has a *run as* link. Clicking this button will open a new tab and you'll see how the app looks and functions as if you were this user.

Note that until you log out, you'll be using the app as this user, so make sure you do not make changes that should not be done.

New view

Clicking this button displays a popup that creates a new database view, which defines the fields that are seen on the right side of the screen. Constraints can be added to create a smaller list. By default, each type has a view that shows most fields with no constraints. The number of views is unlimited, and these views are shared between the Live and Development versions. It is recommended to use new views to build your own admin panel.

Video lessons

- ​[How to create new database views](https://youtu.be/yUB4r-BFzwo)​

Primary fields

Clicking this button opens a popup where you define which field is best to describe a thing in the table. For example, a user may be represented by their email, an apartment, an address, etc. This is for display purposes only within the App Data tab.

If you were to generate a CSV from a view in App Data with primary fields, you would see that chosen field in the appropriate column. This does not apply to workflow actions such as "Download data as CSV."

Ideally, you'll want to pick a field that uniquely represents a thing. For the user type, the email is a great choice, but for other types it depends on your data. As a last resort, the unique ID is always a safe choice as it is unique to the thing.

Search

Enter something into the input box, and the things in the current view that contain the entered text or unique ID are listed. Use this for a quick search of the app data.

Note: When searching in App Data, some common words called “stop words” will be ignored based on your application’s default language.

Search does not cover any fields which are linked data types (not even their primary fields). For example, if you have **Projects**, each with a field for the data type **Company**, and a particular **Project** is tied to Acme Corp, searching **Projects** for Acme will not return that result (unless "Acme" is in one of its other, non-data type fields).

New entry

Clicking this button displays a popup where you create a new database entry. Choose the type of thing and enter information into the predefined fields. This is equivalent to using a 'Create a new thing' action in a workflow.

Note that the data editor currently does not allow modifying a list of things. If you need to modify such fields, building a data admin page in your app is a better option.

Importing data

Clicking the *Upload* button displays a popup where you upload a comma-separated CSV file of data. The type of data and relevant fields should be defined in the app before importing the file. This feature is available to users with a paid Bubble plan.

Select the type of data and file to upload. Map the columns from the file to the fields of the data type and then validate and upload the data. This feature was recently improved and is now in a Beta testing phase.

Important: The first row of your CSV file must be a header row containing the names of the fields for the data. Here's [a sample file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/f1454094816983x291920213727280500/normalfile.csv) for reference.

Data should be valid to be uploaded (a yes/no field should only have yes/no values). Bubble validates all data prior to any upload, if one row is failing, nothing will get created and uploaded to the database. Note that if you are uploading repeatedly large amounts of data, we recommend working with the [Bubble API](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/managing-data/~/comments) and use some scripts to create data, as it's a more scalable approach.

Type of data

Select which type of data to upload. The type of data and relevant fields should be defined in the app before importing the file.

Data delimiter

Commas are typically used to delimit entries, but different delimiters are possible. Tab or pipe delimiters are useful when working with text that includes commas. Choose the delimiter in the application creating the CSV file.

Pick a file to upload

Select a CSV file to upload.

Map fields

This very important step is where you map the columns of data to the fields in the application database.

Custom field

Select a data type field in the dropdown menu for each column of data. These fields should be defined in the data type before the upload.

Composite field

If the field you're matching the column with is a custom type, then specify which field of the subtype should be used to match the text entry. For example, let's say you're uploading a list of apartments, and one of the fields is an owner. If the owner is represented by a last name in the CSV file, choose 'Last name' as the composite field. The entries should exist in the database before you upload the file. If two entries in the Bubble application database match the same value, an error will be returned.

List delimiter

This is the delimiter to use when a field is a list of things. It should be different from the main delimiter. For example, if ';' is used as the delimiter, the data should be in this form: 12;54;32;67.

Note: When importing data for type list, optionally enclose the list in '[' and ']', and then separate the individual items with the delimiter. For example, "[kitchen; bedroom; bathroom]", or "kitchen; bedroom; bathroom".

Validate data

Clicking this button does a quick analysis of the data to be uploaded, to make sure the first couple of rows are valid.

Upload data

Clicking this button uploads the data. First, it uploads the file to our servers. Then, it processes the upload in the background using your server capacity. While this happens, you are free to close the webpage and come back. An email will be sent on completion, or if there is an error while uploading.

Note: Only one upload or modify can occur at a time for a given application.

Modify

You can bulk-modify data via a CSV upload. To do so, you should have a file with a column containing the unique ID of the things you want to modify, and enter the values that should be modified in subsequent columns.

Export

This button generates a CSV file with the data of the current view. The file is exported to the Download folder of your browser. This file can be edited. Because the app owner performs this operation, no privacy rules apply, and all fields chosen in the current view are exported. This feature is available to users with a paid Bubble plan.

At this stage, the CSV file generation is done on the client; if you are exporting a large amount of data, we recommend using the [Bubble GET API](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/managing-data/~/comments) to read your database content with a script.

**Tip:** Make sure your Scheduler is not paused before you export a CSV.

Switch to live/dev database

Clicking this displays the Version dropdown menu to switch between the Development and Live versions of the app. Remember that each version has a separate database.

Cleaning data

It’s important to keep your database clean from time to time, especially as you scale. Here are some tips on how you can easily and efficiently keep your database in good shape!

If you’re no longer using a data type, you can delete the data type in the Data types section in the Data Tab of your app. Click on the trash icon next to the data type. This will delete all database things of that data type throughout your database. Please note you cannot recover the data after it’s deleted.

If you’d like to delete individual database things, you can navigate to the relevant database view in the App Data section in the Data Tab of your app. If you’d like to filter the things you’d like to delete, you can create a new database view with the “New view” button and add constraints to filter the data. You can either individually click on database things one-by-one to delete, or you can use the checkmark at the top of the first row to select all database things in the view and bulk delete. Additionally, you can run a [bulk action](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/maintaining-an-application/bulk-operations) that calls an API workflow to delete database things iteratively.

- ​Newline-Delimited JSON (NDJSON)​

How to export data

To start the export process, first navigate to *Data - App data*.

- Select the data type you want to export.
- Set up the *View* to reflect the list that you want to export.
- Click the *Export* button (see screenshot above).
- In the popup, select the format that you want to export to.
- Bubble will send you an email when the export is done, with a link to download the file.

**Known issue:** When exporting a datatype with a date interval field, the field is exported as descriptive text, although it is stored as a numerical value in milliseconds in the database. For example, the value 172,800,000 milliseconds (48 hours) would be displayed in the database editor and exported as "2 days". When importing date intervals, Bubble still expects a numerical value in milliseconds.

Reference: [Upload data as CSV](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/data-thingupload-data-as-csv)​

How to import a CSV file

Formatting the file

The file needs to be of type CSV (comma-separated values), which you can export from apps like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets and Apple Numbers.

To ensure Bubble accurately interprets the data in your file, it's important to format it correctly. Most fields follow standard formatting conventions, though certain complex types, such as date ranges and intervals, may require specific formatting to be recognized properly. The first row of your CSV file must be a header row containing the names of the fields for the data.

Note that in the file you want to import, the rows and columns are transposed. Yo

**Metadata** contained in the following fields is automatically created and updated by Bubble and is not possible to import from a CSV:

- Unique ID
- Creator
- Modified Date
- Created Date
- Slug

If these fields are included, they will be automatically set to *ignore this column*.

Accessing the import feature

The CSV import feature is found in the *Data - App data* section of the Bubble editor. After navigating there, click the *Upload* button.

![upload-csv-bubble-editor@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FsDeSNVNNc8NM8CSYdP54%2Fupload-csv-bubble-editor%402x.png?alt=media&token=9f97961f-5204-4cf4-84bc-e9f57333d48e)

Click the *Upload* button in the database editor to start the import process. Remember to first select the correct data type in the left-hand list.

The import popup

To successfully import the file, you need to keep the popup open until the file has **uploaded.** When the second progress bar (*Processing file)* is visible and starting to fill, you can close the popup and keep working in your app.

The import popup will be displayed, where you can set the correct settings for the import:

![upload-csv-popup-bubble@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FA8AQ1s8I6RayzxB5r56t%2Fupload-csv-popup-bubble%402x.png?alt=media&token=3b6ad949-ab11-40eb-9719-55159e5d22e0)

- First, **select the data type** that you want to import. Note that we have named the data type CSV in the example.
- **Pick the data delimiter**. This is the character that separates the data, so that Bubble understands its rows and columns. The comma is the most widely used, but the delimiter can be one of the following:
   - ,
   - ;
   - tab
   - |
- **Select the file to upload** from your device (opens system file browser)
- **Map fields**: Bubble will attempt to match the columns in the file with the correct field on the selected data type. In the example, we have named the fields according to their type of data.
- **Choose delimiters on fields**: some fields, such as date ranges, need a valid delimiter. This is normally a comman, but the characters listed in point 2 are all valid.
- **Validate the data**: the next step is to instruct Bubble to check the data in the file against the fields you have mapped. If successful, you will get a success message. If there are any errors, they will be listed after you click the *Validate data* button.

FAQ: CSV import

Can you upload more than one data type at a time?

You can only upload one data type at a time.

Can I create new fields on the data type based on columns in the file?

No, all fields must be created and have matching names before they are uploaded.

----
 Working with location data

Maps and geolocation features in Bubble rely on Google APIs. Once your app uses your own domain, it will require your own Google API keys in the Settings > General > "General services API Keys" section. This guide covers how to obtain your own keys.

**Tip:** The Google API gets used for timezones as well as geographic addresses, so if you're using "Current user's timezone" or addresses anywhere in your app, go ahead and update these keys.

***Note:*** In May 2020, Google changed its APIs to split off timezone capabilities (previously part of a bundle of Geocode capabilities) into its own API. This means you will have to add the Time Zone API to the capabilities of your app when registering it with Google.

[](https://youtu.be/ouGT55o68ho)

Our Academy tutorial on how to set up Google API keys
 Set up your app in Google Developers Console

You first need to set up your account in the Google Developers Console - this tells Google about your app and is how Google will know which APIs your app is allowed to invoke.

Visit the console [here](https://console.developers.google.com/). You will have to log in; you may also have to provide billing details, which is a requirement from Google.

First, create a "project" in Google that corresponds to your Bubble app; your interface may look something like this:

![Screen Shot 2019-11-05 at 4.38.38 PM.png](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smw_6-sWWHG9X1IV9%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-11-05%20at%204.38.38%20PM.png?alt=media)

Then, with that project active (i.e. name showing in the topbar), click on the menu icon in the upper left > APIs & Services > Library:

![Screen Shot 2019-11-05 at 4.38.43 PM.png](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smw_8XOtX41oSIcFF%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-11-05%20at%204.38.43%20PM.png?alt=media)

In the Library, search for the following APIs and "Enable" each one:

- Geocoding API
- Places API
- Geolocation API
- Maps JavaScript API
- ***(New in May 2020)*** Time Zone API

Create and set up your new keys

Now visit the menu icon in the upper left > APIs & Services > Credentials. Create 2 new API keys (in the "Create credentials" button), and edit one of them to be called "Client" and the other to be called "Server".

We now want to apply some restrictions to the keys as a form of security.

Click into the Client key's settings, and under "Application restrictions", choose "HTTP referrers (web sites)". Then under the "Website restrictions" section, add your Bubble app's URL, for instance like "[https://appname.bubbleapps.io/](https://appname.bubbleapps.io/)*". This restriction means that only your Bubble app can use the Client key. The "*" is a "wildcard" which means that any URL starting with "[https://appname.bubbleapps.io/](https://appname.bubbleapps.io/)" will be accepted. If you're using a custom domain, you should add [https://yourdomain.com/*](https://yourdomain.com/*) as a website restriction for the Client Key. If the domain connected to your app is a subdomain, then you should add https://*.*[*http://yourdomain.com/*](http://yourdomain.com/)**|[yourdomain.com/*](http://yourdomain.com/*)

Then, click into the Server key's settings, and look at the "API restrictions" section. Choose "Restrict key", and then in the dropdown, select all 5 of the APIs you enabled above. This restriction means that the Server key can only use these 5 Google APIs. ***(New in May 2020 -*** *Note that now you must enable all 5 of the APIs, whereas before there were only 4 to enable.)*

The keys are now all set to be used! In a different tab, go back to your Bubble editor and go to Settings > General. In the "General services API keys" section, copy and paste the Server key into the "Google Geocode API key" box, and the Client key into the "Google Map API key" box. You should now be all set up.

Further notes on the Google side

- The generic instructions provided by Google for setting up an API key are [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) for Maps and [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key) for Geocode; the instructions on this Manual page are accurate as of January 2020, but as Google updates their interface, please refer to their official documentation as needed
- In order to use these APIs, you may need to set up a billing account with Google Cloud and connect your Google project with that billing account
- Note that changes in a Google project configuration can take a minute or so to propagate and take effect

Watch out

Because Bubble uses the Google Maps API, there are some inconsistencies in Google Maps data that will reflect in the app. For example, for some (non-US) addresses, the "city' field is actually the name of the neighborhood / area. To help mitigate this, try adding a Map element (even a hidden one) that takes as its value the value from a SearchBox input - the Map will place the pin correctly, and then its "center" might yield more accurate data about that location.

 Using Algolia

This section covers how to use the third-party search provider Algolia with Bubble

Bubble has an integration with [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/), a third-party search-as-a-service provider. Bubble apps using this integration have their data sent to Algolia for indexing, and use Algolia as a data source to power elements like repeating groups and searchboxes.

Benefits of Algolia

What are the benefits of using Algolia? A noticeable one for your users is speed - Algolia searches are fast, and noticeably faster than Bubble native searches at scale. A second one is customizability - Algolia allows you to tweak the search algorithm, among other parameters as well.

Note that unlike a plugin which must be installed, this integration is built natively into the editor, much like Bubble’s integrations with Google Maps and Google Geocode.

**Who should consider this**

Bubble does have native search capabilities, but Algolia provides a more performant and customizable search experience at scale. Users of this integration will also need their own Algolia plan (though Algolia also offers a free tier). In other words, Algolia is more suitable for Bubble apps at a large scale that rely on search as an important part of their user experience; thus, this feature is only available for Bubble apps on the Professional plan and above.

Setup

To start off, you must have your own Algolia account and copy your Algolia keys into your app’s Settings. When creating an Algolia account, you **do not** have to create indices yourself. Instead, right after signing up, you should visit the "API Keys" section of the dashboard. You will see a screen like this:

![algolia_keys.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/f1585840673248x789535177939069300/algolia_keys.png)

In your Bubble app, in Settings > General in the "General services API Keys" section, there is a checkbox for "Enable searching with Algolia" (if you do not see this checkbox, your app does not have this feature, chances are because it is not in the right tier). Once you check the box, you will see input fields for the application ID and two keys from the Algolia dashboard. Once you've copied and pasted those values in, the Bubble app will confirm that it thinks the keys are of the correct format (note the green text below):

![algolia_settings.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/f1585840814678x830973864721420500/algolia_settings.png)

The other parts of the Algolia feature mentioned below will not appear until valid keys and an application ID have been supplied in Settings.

I**ndexing**

After keys have been added, in the Privacy tab for every data type, you’ll see the option to index that type with Algolia.

![algolia_privacy_tab.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/f1585840930894x345364301566459140/algolia_privacy_tab.png)

If a data type is indexed to Algolia, Bubble will send **all public fields** to Algolia, i.e. the fields that are visible via search in the “Everyone else (default permissions)” Privacy rule. Bubble will automatically create the necessary indexes in Algolia for you - **you should not rename those indexes**.

In addition, make sure that the data type being indexed has **"Find this in searches"** under the "Everyone else" permission checked.

After you toggle a data type to be indexed by Algolia (checkbox on the right), you will probably want to trigger an indexing of all the things of that type. You can do so in the modal accessed at the top of the Privacy page for any indexed type.

![algolia_indexing_modal.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/f1585840975838x691412509932716700/algolia_indexing_modal.png)

You can choose to trigger a full indexing of all indexed types or just one type, and you can choose to do this for your Development database ("test"), Live database, or both. Note that doing a full indexing could take noticeable capacity over a period of time (depending on how many things there are), so the recommendation is to trigger a full indexing once after adjusting all your data types’ settings, and to do it at non-peak hours. Behind-the-scenes, the full indexing runs the same process as a large CSV data export, so you can actually see the status of these tasks in App Data > Export.

When things of an indexed data type are changed, added, or deleted, Bubble will automatically try to update the corresponding Algolia index for you. This should be generally reliable, but in the event that you find Algolia “out of sync” with your Bubble database, you can always trigger a full re-indexing in the same way as above.

During set-up, after you run the first indexing, we recommend you check the Algolia portal to make sure that you're seeing the records you expect in the newly created indices.

S**earching**

Once you’ve activated Algolia for your app, you will see a new data source, “Search with Algolia”. For example, this can be the data source for a repeating group, or the “Choices style” for a searchbox. The Algolia data source also lets you choose to query over a specific field, or all fields of a data type.

You cannot change the sort order of an Algolia result in Bubble because that is controlled in Algolia. After all, we are relying on their search expertise, manifested in their algorithm! You are able to customize the Algolia search algorithm for a particular index via the Algolia dashboard. For example, you can change the weights of different fields in the search algorithm. Note: one limitation of the current integration is that you should not set two fields as “equal weight” in the Algolia interface.

Note that the default setting in Algolia is to return 20 entries in the first 'page' of the search. At this time there's no way for your Bubble app to access other pages of results, but you can change the number of results in the first page by going to the Algolia portal > the appropriate index > Configuration > Pagination.

Known limitations

This is the v1 of the Algolia feature. It has these known limitations:

- This only supports **text** and **number** fields. For all other field types (including fields which are other custom data types), Bubble will make a "best effort" attempt to send those fields to Algolia, but it will likely not be sensible. To restate explicitly, the Algolia integration is not meant for other fields like dates, geographic addresses, ranges, Users, or fields that are other custom data types.
- This only supports **public data fields**, so it is not good in situations where data privacy is very important, e.g. when you want to prevent one user from seeing another user's data. For example, it is good if you have a short-term rental marketplace app where all users can see any rental on the app. It is not good for an e-commerce experience where you have many vendors and you want to build a search for only one vendor's products.
- Algolia has limits on the size of certain fields. If Bubble detects that a given Thing has a field that is too long (text fields are the most likely culprit), it will automatically clip them for you so that it can be sent to Algolia. This can be disabled in Settings, but should only be done so by advanced users who are accounting for this in Algolia's settings.
- In Algolia's settings, you may see an option to rank two fields as "equal weight" - please **do not** do this, as it will break the Bubble integration.
- Bubble will automatically create the indices in Algolia - please **do not** change the names of these indices, though you are free to adjust other settings as desired.

 Marketplace Apps

*By Daniel Abebe, co-founder of HuggyStudio*

*Various members of the Bubble ecosystem contributed these use case-oriented database guides. There's always more than one way to do something in Bubble, but the advice here can help you get started if you're new to Bubble!*

Marketplaces connect multiple sellers of goods or services with buyers. Most of the time, a marketplace is created to bring more transparency into a market or make the buying process more efficient. While they can differ vastly from managed marketplaces to niche and B2B marketplaces, the standard business model is to capture value from each transaction. Famous examples include Airbnb, Amazon, Upwork, AliExpress.

In this guide, we take you through the creation of the data structure for a home rental marketplace like Airbnb.

If you are not familiar with Airbnb, here is a quick introduction into our use case with an overview of the basic functionality:

- Airbnb is a leading online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with travelers who are looking for an accommodation.
- Basic functionality includes:
- For both homeowners and travelers
- Signup / Login for homeowners and travelers
- Edit profile information
- For homeowners
- Upload/edit place (Pictures, Address, Price, Description, Amenities, …)
- Set place availability / unavailability
- Manage bookings
- Receive ratings
- Messaging with travelers who booked the place
- For travelers
- Discover and filter places based on location, type of place, price, rating, amenities and/or facilities
- Book a place
- Message with the homeowner after booking the place
- Rate place

Data types recommended

Users will upload and edit places. On the other hand, users will book and rate places. A messaging function will be possible for each booking. Places need to hold structured data so that users can easily filter places based on different criteria like price, location, type of places, …

Good to know: In our use case, bookings are immediate and do not require a confirmation by the homeowner.

User (default)

The Data Type “User” is by default already available on [Bubble.io](http://Bubble.io). It helps you handle user authentication. Both sides of our marketplace (homeowners AND travelers) are users. In our example, the same user can upload places and/or book a place.

Suggested fields on this type

- email (text) - this is a built-in field, i.e. it’s already there for you
- Modified date (date) - also a built-in field
- Created date (date) - also a built-in field
- Slug (text) - also a built-in field
- First name (text)
- Last name (text)
- My places (list of Places): Places uploaded by the user for rent; see [this article](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/structuring-an-application/data-structure%23connecting-types&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649795051390507&usg=AOvVaw0IPM-W8tdCN0uPvkfbWnBi) on linking data types
- My trips (list of Bookings): Bookings made by the user (as a traveler)
- Admin? (yes/no): this defines the users who can access the platform’s admin dashboard where you can approve new places or review the overall platform activity. For your information, this is not a standard Bubble page - this page also needs to be built.

Privacy rules for this data type

Place

This Data Type is used to manage all data related to a property on our home rental marketplace. A User can upload multiple places.

Suggested fields on this type

- Creator (User, built-in)
- Modified date (date, built-in)
- Created date (date, built-in)
- Slug (text, built-in)
- Title (text): Name of the place like “Beautiful house in the mountains”
- Description (text): Description to get more information about the place
- Price/night in USD (number)
- Pictures (list of images)
- Number of beds (number)
- Number of guests max (number)
- Bookings (list of Bookings): All bookings made for this place are saved back in this list to keep track of the place performance and availability. It also helps to pull all relevant data faster for the homeowner.
- Unavailability (list of date ranges): In our use case, we assume a place is always available except if a new unavailability was added to this list. This is a more scalable approach than requiring the homeowner to enter availability each month.

Privacy rules for this data type

- No privacy rules required as Users need all information when browsing through or searching for places. Even the Bookings should be visible so that Users can see the ratings and the actual Place Availability. Under the Data Type “Booking”, we will add Privacy Rules to make sure only public information is accessible.
- Depending on the experience you want to offer to your Homeowners when creating/editing their place, you could create a Privacy Rule just for allowing auto-binding to homeowners. With a “Save” button, auto-binding is not necessary.

Booking

The Data Type “Booking” is used to manage all data related to a booking on our home rental marketplace. A User can make several bookings of different places over their lifetime.

Suggested fields on this type

- Creator (User, built-in)
- Modified date (date, built-in)
- Created date (date, built-in)
- Slug (text, built-in)
- Homeowner (User): We can assume the creator of a place is the homeowner. Anyhow, by adding this “Homeowner” field, we have more flexibility when it comes to HOW a place is created. As an example, admins will be able to create a flat and simply add the rightful homeowner.
- Booked place (Place): We connect the booking back to the place to avoid orphaned entries (a booking with no place)
- Date range (date range): This will indicate the check-in and check-out of this trip.
- Number of nights (number): The number of nights is already available when we extract that information from the booking date range. Anyhow, saving it as a separate value will make it easier to display or calculate total costs for example.
- Total costs in USD (number)
- Chat (list of Messages): A chat is as simple as a list of messages that show chronologically. As a chat is only relevant to a booking, we store this list of messages directly under the booking.
- Rating stars (number): As a rating is connected to a single booking, we store the value directly under the booking.
- Rating comment (text): Same as rating stars.

Privacy rules for this data type

- This Booking’s creator is Current User OR This Booking’s Homeowner is Current User
- View all fields (checked)
- Find this in search (checked)
- View attached files (checked)
- Allow auto-binding (unchecked)
- Everyone else
- View all fields (unchecked)
- Creator (checked)
- Date range (checked)
- Rating starts (checked)
- Rating comment (checked)
- Find this in search (unchecked)
- Allow auto-binding (unchecked)

Message

The Data Type “Message” is used to store text messages sent between users. A message doesn’t need to hold much information besides its content as it is stored in a list of messages under the booking already. This booking holds all relevant information like users in the chat, the booking dates and the specific place this chat is about.

Suggested fields on this type

- Creator (User, built-in)
- Modified date (date, built-in)
- Created date (date, built-in)
- Slug (text, built-in)
- Text message (text)
- Booking chat (Booking): We link this message back to the booking to avoid orphaned messages (a message saved in the database with no link to a booking chat). This also makes it possible to create privacy rules linking back to the booking.

Privacy rules for this data type:

- This Message’s creator is Current User OR This Message’s Booking’s Homeowner is Current User
- View all fields (checked)
- Find this in search (checked)
- View attached files (checked)
- Allow auto-binding (unchecked)
- Everyone else
- No permission

Option sets recommended

Type of place

- Entire place
- Private room
- Shared room
- Hotel room

“Type of place” is a classic example of an option set. We use options to store different predefined types. Those types rarely change and users are not asked to create new types.

Good to know: We can also use a standard Data Type for “Type of place”. The rule of thumb is that if users do not have to create entries themselves, an option set is a better choice as it improves the app performance.

Place status

- In review
- Approved
- Rejected

Similar to a “Type of place”, a “Place status” is another good example of an option set. We use options to store different predefined statuses. Those statuses rarely change and users are not asked to create new statuses.

Amenities

- Wifi
- Heating
- TV
- Air conditioning
- Indoor fireplace
- Washer
- …

We use option sets to standardize the amenities. Users should not be able to enter free text and create new amenities. This helps avoid fantasy amenities or duplicates. It also makes filtering places easier.

Facilities

- Free parking
- Gym
- Pool
- Hot tub

Similar to amenities, we use option sets to standardize the facilities. Users should not be able to enter free text and create new facilities. This helps avoid fantasy facilities or duplicates. It also makes filtering places easier.

Additional notes

When naming your options sets, data types and fields, we recommend using simple terms you will remember over time. Also, avoid repetition in your names as it will make it difficult to work efficiently when building your workflows. Finally, keep in mind that working with data is an ongoing process. Start small, adjust when necessary and improve as your product grows in terms of users and/or complexity.

 Directory & Listings Apps

*By Gaby Román, Co-Founder of Coaching No Code Apps*

*Various members of the Bubble ecosystem contributed these use case-oriented database guides. There's always more than one way to do something in Bubble, but the advice here can help you get started if you're new to Bubble!*

Directory apps are typically designed as user-friendly databases that make it easy to find a specific listing or profile. For example, TripAdvisor is a directory of businesses that can be easily searched, where search results appear in a list or map format. Users can then select a business and view more details about it.

The following data structure is recommended for applications where users are generating listings or profiles for other users to find. These listings or profiles can help users hire for services, purchase products, book reservations, network with others, etc. Typically, these listings or profiles can be reviewed and rated by other users. Popular examples of this type of app include: Yelp, Airbnb, TripAdvisor, Amazon’s product search, LinkedIn, etc.

These suggested data types and option sets should help you build common functionality for directory apps in a way that keeps things scalable.

Data types recommended

These data types will allow users to create their own listings, categorize them, and upload images. The app’s front-end design would dynamically display this content in a single layout. Users would first search for listings with any relevant filters, select one from the results, and then view the full details of their selection. The layout would look the same for all listings, but the content would be different.

Users can also create reviews of any listing they see. The listing or profile page would then display all related reviews with an aggregated score or star rating.

Search is typically a core feature for an app like this, so the following types and option sets create powerful filtering flexibility. Users should be able to select multiple filters in different combinations to find the exact results they’re looking for. This is possible by relating listings to specific categories, aggregating their review ratings, and saving helpful properties like location, dates, statuses, etc.

User

This is Bubble’s only built-in data type. Anyone who needs to be able to log into the app should have a User record.

Suggested fields on this type

- First Name (text)
- Last Name (text)
- Favorite Listings (list of Listings): This is a [relationship field](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/structuring-an-application/data-structurconnecting-types) that links the User to a list of Listing records, which are organized under a separate “Listing” data type.
- Type (list of User Types, an option set): Users can be more than one type of user, which will help you create conditions and/or privacy rules around what data or features they have access to in the app.
- For example, a “Listing Owner” should have the ability to manage their own listings whereas “Consumers” can only search, view, and review listings.
- Airbnb has Hosts and Guests. While a user can technically be both, it’s important to know what kind of interaction they’re coming to the app for. Hosts have the ability to create listings, whereas Guests have the ability to book listings. Hosts can view payments received, whereas Guests can view payments made, etc.
- System Admins typically refer to you, the app builder, to create global access to all parts of the app.
- See how this field influences privacy rules for the Listings data type, below

Privacy rules for this data type

This type of application is structured to make Users and/or separate Listings easy to find, so there isn’t as big of a need to restrict this type. With that said, we do have a few minimum recommendations: only allowing the user to auto-bind on their own record and “view” their own sensitive field values. System admins may get these abilities as well.

- Current User is This User > all access
- Current User is not This User and Current User’s Type doesn’t include System Admin > find in searches, view all fields except sensitive fields (home address, emergency contact, etc.), no auto-binding
- Current User’s Type includes System Admin > all access

Listing

This is the heart of a directory app. Users will search all Listings, so make sure you include fields for any details that need to be displayed to the user or which can help filter search results.

Suggested fields on this type

- Title (text)
- Description (text)
- Location (geographic address)
- Owner (User): While Bubble has a built-in “Creator” field for all data types, having a custom Owner field like this will allow you to change owners. If you make this a list of Users, then you can create multi-owner / multi-editor capabilities.
- Categories (list of Categories): This field will help any search functionality filter Listings by Category.‘
- Featured (yes/no): This field can help you sort results by showing any Listings where “Features = yes” at the top of the list.
- Status (Listing Status, an option set)
- Average Rating (number): This value can be re-calculated every time a new review is created for the Listing. It will also help users filter their searches based on a rating minimum and/or sort by rating.

Privacy rules for this data type

Given that this is the heart of the application, you can create many rules around the type to specify access rights. Here are some suggested rules that allow Listing Owners to modify their own Listing, System Admins to access everything, and Users unrelated to the Listing to view but not edit it:

- Current User is This Listing’s Owner > find in searches, enable auto-binding on all fields except the “Status” and “Featured” fields since those are reserved for the System Admin to update.
- Current User’s Type is System Admin > all access
- Current User is not This Listing’s Owner and This Listing’s Status is Published > find in searches and view all fields

Review

Reviews are common in directory apps to help users find the most popular entities by seeing how other Users have rated them.

Suggested fields on this type

- Related Listing (Listing): This field ties the Review back to the Listing it’s about.
- Rating (number): Whether review ratings are on a specific scale or not (e.g. 0-5 stars), saving any kind of number to each review will allow you to calculate Listing Review averages by aggregating on this field.
- Comment (text)
- Images (list of images): If it makes sense to allow consumers to upload images alongside their review (think Amazon product reviews), then this field will support that.

Privacy rules for this data type

Reviews should only be modified by the user who created it. This also applies to the System Admin to maintain integrity:

- Current User is This Review’s Creator > all access
- Everyone Else (Default Rule) > find in searches, view all fields, no auto-binding

Image

Depending on how important images are for your directory app’s Listings, you may want to store any related images in a separate data type. For example, Airbnb listings contain many images for the accommodation, and organizing those in a separate data type allows you to save separate captions per image or indicate which ones should be the featured image; as opposed to an internal company staff directory where the only image might be the person’s headshot which can be saved directly to the Listing itself.

Suggested fields on this type

- Related Listing (Listing): This field ties the Image back to the Listing.
- File (image): This is the uploaded image itself. We’ve labeled it “File” so that your expressions can read “Image’s File” even though technically the field type is an image and not a file.
- Caption (text)
- Featured (yes/no)

Privacy rules for this data type

Images should follow nearly the same set of rules as their parent listing to allow creators to manage them only:

- Current User is This Image’s Creator > all access
- Everyone Else (Default Rule) > find in searches, view all fields, no auto-binding

Category

If your users should be allowed to create categories or you plan on having dozens or even hundreds of categories, use a separate data type to organize them. Otherwise, if your app’s category list is more contained and users can’t create new ones, then an option set might be more convenient.

Suggested fields on this type

- Name (text)
- Parent Category (Category): This field will help you create an infinite hierarchy of categories and sub-categories. Any Category without a parent will tell you that’s the top of its hierarchy. Any Category with a parent will tell you it’s a sub-category of another Category.

Privacy rules for this data type

The privacy rules here can vary depending on how much control you want your users to have over them. Let’s assume that while users can generate categories, they can only modify their own. Some of the logic around editing conditions may need to be set up within the workflows and element design. For example, users can only edit if there are no listings attached to their category.

- Current User is This Category’s creator > all access
- Everyone Else (Default Rule) > find in searches, view all fields, no auto-binding

If the System Admin is the only person who should be able to edit Categories, then these rules are more appropriate:

- Current User’s Type includes System Admin > all access
- Everyone Else (Default Rule) > find in searches, view all fields, no auto-binding

Option sets recommended

Listing Status

- Draft
- Under Review
- Published
- Archived

Many directory or listings applications will have content creators (in this case, listing owners) create the entity as a draft first and then submit it to the platform for review. If accepted, the platform will change the status to Published so that only Listings where “Status = Published” appear in search results.

User Type

- System Admin
- Listing Owner
- Consumer

If your application has different types of users where access to data, pages, even workflows are specific to that type, an option set is a great way to identify who the users are. By making the “Type” field under the User data type a list, Users can be more than one Type (if necessary).

Example uses in your app

- Search for Listings within 10 miles of a selected location
- If this app is meant to connect a user with home renovation professionals, then they may want to do a search with a location constraint (and sort by best rated).
- The following expression can generate the appropriate listings in a repeating group:
- Search for Listings (Status = Published; Location is within radius input’s value of location input’s value; Categories includes category dropdown’s value; sorted by Average Rating)
- Search for Listings that are at least 4 stars or above and are the newest in the system
- Search for Listings (Status = Published; Average Rating >= 4; sorted by Creation Date)

Additional notes

Keep in mind that your directory app will have customizations not covered here. Whenever you need to store a unique combination of values, consider creating a new data type. For example, the Review data type is the unique combination of a User (consumer), a Listing, and the User’s rating for that Listing.

You might also notice that we don’t have very many list fields to create one to many relationships. We recommend using list fields when the number of items in the list is going to be relatively small. For example, a Listing may have up to 5 Categories whereas it could have hundreds of Reviews. So, for better performance, we chose not to have a list of Reviews under the Listing data type. Instead, as long as the Review has a “Related Listing” field, we have everything we need to find that Listing’s Reviews.

 Social Network Apps

*By Daniel Abebe, co-founder of HuggyStudio*

*Various members of the Bubble ecosystem contributed these use case-oriented database guides. There's always more than one way to do something in Bubble, but the advice here can help you get started if you're new to Bubble!*

Social Networks serve the main purpose of connecting people or businesses together. Most of the time, they are built to scale and have a business model focused on ad revenues. Their form and target audience can vary greatly. Famous examples include Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Linkedin.

In this guide, we take you through the creation of the data structure for a social network like LinkedIn called “NoCodeLinkedin”. Good to know: NoCodeLinkedin is a real use case built on [Bubble.io](http://Bubble.io) that you can check out here: [https://nocodelinkedin.com/](https://nocodelinkedin.com/).

If you are not familiar with LinkedIn, here is a quick introduction into our use case with an overview of the basic functionality:

- LinkedIn is the world’s largest professional network. LinkedIn helps professionals find talent, job opportunities, stay in touch with their contacts and extend their network.
- Basic functionality includes:
- Sign up / Log in
- Edit profile (Name, Bio, Headline, Experience)
- Connection requests (Send, accept, ignore)
- Create a new post
- React to a post (Like, Celebrate, Support, …)
- Comment on a post
- Private chats
- Notifications

Data types recommended

After signing up, users will edit their profile and start sending connection requests. Later on, users will create posts and will scroll through the latest activity of his/her network. Last but not least, the user will also react and comment on other users’ posts. The data structure we are creating needs to take all of these actions into account.

User (default)

The Data Type “User” is by default already available on any Bubble app. It helps you handle user authentication. As a rule of thumb, if someone needs to signup/login to your platform, this person is considered to be a User. In our case, all NoCodeLinkedin profiles are actual Users.

 SaaS Apps

*By Gaby Román, Co-Founder of Coaching No Code Apps*

*Various members of the Bubble ecosystem contributed these use case-oriented database guides. There's always more than one way to do something in Bubble, but the advice here can help you get started if you're new to Bubble!*

SaaS app data structures are unique in that almost all of the data needs to be organized under an account hierarchy. For example, every user that signs up might represent a company, so they may have a team, customers, and other resources that should all link back to that parent company.

The following data structure is recommended for companies that need a project management tool for internal operations. Users of the app can create and organize projects with related tasks. For example, a manufacturing company with product design and marketing teams would be able to manage the various to-do items within their departments while company managers can track company-wide project statuses and assignments. Overall, this would streamline communications between teams, better visualize company metrics, and help management make more intuitive business decisions.

Data types recommended

These data types are designed from the perspective of one company. Every company that signs up to your app will have a single “Company” record in the database, one or more “Users” (team members, managers, etc.), and related resources that are unique to the Company, such as “Customers,” “Projects,” and “Tasks.” The “Subscription” and “Plan” data types will help you manage each Company’s subscription with you, the app owner. The more Companies that sign up, the more records are created, but the key is to relate Company specific records like Customer or Project back to the parent Company for data security.

User

This is Bubble’s only built-in data type. Anyone who needs to be able to log into the app should have a User record.

**Suggested fields on this type**

- First Name (text)
- Last Name (text)
- Related Company (Company): This field is important for knowing which data the user has access to and can be leveraged in many different privacy rules.
   - Privacy rule example under Customer: “When This Customer’s Related Company is not the Current User’s Related Company” > disable all checkboxes
- Role (User Role, an option set): By assigning users with specific roles, you can control their access to pages, visual elements, and workflows. For example, a User whose Role is Company Admin can have the ability to create other Company Members, whereas Company Members themselves cannot.

**Privacy rules for this data type**

The User’s “Role” and “Related Company” will be the starting point for creating privacy rules both for the User data type itself and all other Company-specific types.

For the User data type, we suggest creating a rule that only allows users to access other user records within their same company, not other companies. You can do this with the following rule: “Current User’s Related Company is This User’s Related Company.”

You can break this down one step further by only giving Company Admins the ability to view more fields and/or edit other Company users; in addition, allowing the current user to have full access to their own record:

- Current User’s Related Company is This User’s Related Company and Current User’s Role is ‘Company Admin’ > view all fields, allow auto-binding
- Current User’s Related Company is This User’s Related Company and Current User’s Role is ‘Company Member’ > view selected fields, don’t allow auto-binding
- Current User is This User > allow everything

Company

This is a very important data type for SaaS structures because it’s the most parent entity that will help you segment the rest of your app’s data in a single application. [Sub-app](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/customizing-an-application/sub-apps) structures don’t require this as much if each sub-app is created per company, in which case, they’re already given independent databases. Whether this data type represents a “Company” or an “Account,” make sure all other data types whose records are unique to their parent have a field that ties back to this record.

**Suggested fields on this type**

- Name (text)
- Admin (User): While this field isn’t necessary (as long as you can identify Users by their role and related Company), it’s a very handy “shortcut” to the Company’s Admin, especially if you need to reference that user often.
- Related Subscription (Subscription): This is a reference to the custom Subscription record created for this Company. It’s another shortcut field that is typically helpful if you have multiple pricing plans that tier off features. Having quick access to the “Company’s *Related Subscription’s Plan” can make it easier to create conditional expressions.*

**Privacy rules for this data type**

Users should only be able to access their own Company’s record, which you can do with the following: Current User’s Related Company is This Company > allow full access

If you have a User Role for a System Admin (i.e. yourself, the app owner), then you can create a more global rule to give you access to all Companies, like this: Current User’s Role is System Admin > allow full access

The default “Everyone Else” rule should have all access options disabled. If the user is not a part of the Company nor a System Admin, then they cannot access the Company record in question.

Plan

This is a helpful data type to organize all your subscription plan levels. Our example includes an ID field for a payment gateway (e.g. Stripe, PayPal, etc.) so you have an easy reference to the equivalent entity on the gateway’s side. Note that this is not unique to a Company.

**Suggested fields on this type**

- Name (text)
- Description (text)
- Amount (number): This would be the amount charged for every billing cycle. E.g. 50 if frequency is set to “Month” vs 500 if frequency is set to “Year” for a discounted annual plan.
- Frequency (Plan Frequency, an option set)

**Privacy rules for this data type**

This data type doesn’t need a privacy rule because it’s not tied to any specific Company and holds no sensitive information. It’s a general system table that describes Subscription Plan options. These need to be available to everyone, including logged out users.

Subscription

This record saves the unique combination of a selected plan for a Company and any details about the Subscription itself such as the active date and status.

**Suggested fields on this type**

- Related Company (Company)
- Related Plan (Plan)
- Active Date (date)
- Canceled Date (date)
- Status (Plan Status, an option set): This is a helpful field to keep track of which Companies are active or not and what kind of access they should have.
- Payment Gateway ID (text)

**Privacy rules for this data type**

Create rules that give the System Admin and Company Admins access to this record:

- Current User’s Role is System Admin > allow full access
- Current User’s Role is Company Admin and Current User’s Related Company is This Subscription’s Related Company > allow full access

Customer

This is an example of a Company resource they might need in a SaaS app. Each Company would have their own Customers to build out their CRM. Again, don’t forget to include the “Related Company” field so that Company users can only have access to Company Customers.

**Suggested fields on this type**

- Related Company (Company)
- First Name (text)
- Last Name (text)
- Phone Number (text): While it might be tempting to create this as a number, you’ll be able to format phone numbers better for different countries if it's text. Plus, you never need to do math with phone numbers, so you’re not losing any capability.
- Email Address (text)
- Notes (text)

**Privacy rules for this data type**

Only System admins and Company users should be able to access Customers that are tied to their same Company:

- Current User’s Role is System Admin > allow full access
- Current User’s Related Company is This Company > allow full access

If you want to split up access to fields and auto-binding by Company Role, you can create separate rules per Role to break that down.

Project

This is another company-specific resource record.

**Suggested fields on this type**

- Related Company (Company)
- Title (text)
- Manager (User): This is a shortcut field to the Company User (whether their role is Admin or Member) that is responsible for this specific project.
- Team Members (list of Users): This is a shortcut field to any Company Users that might be assigned Tasks for this Project.
- Due Date (date)

**Privacy rules for this data type**

Follow the same rules you created for the Customer data type.

Task

This is another company-specific resource record and is seen as a “child” of the Project data type. Meaning, a Project is made up of a list of Tasks, but notice how we didn’t include a List of Tasks field under the Project data type. Since a Project could be long-term and potentially have hundreds of tasks, it’s better to have a one-way relationship on the Task side for performance. See [this article](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/structuring-an-application/data-structurconnecting-types).

**Suggested fields on this type**

- Related Company (Company)
- Related Project (Project)
- Title (text)
- Due Date (date)
- Completed Date (date)
- Assigned To (list of Users): Here, we chose to make this a list in case a Task should have the ability to be assigned to more than one person.

**Privacy rules for this data type**

Follow the same rules you created for the Customer data type.

Option sets recommended

User Role

- System Admin
- Company Admin
- Company Member

If your application offers different roles where access to data, pages, or even workflows are specific to that role, an option set is a great way to identify who the users are.

Plan Status

- Active
- Inactive

Plan Frequency

- Month
- Year

Example uses in your app

- Viewing Projects Assigned to Me
   - Once the user logs into the app and opens up their “dashboard” page, they should be able to see a list of projects with tasks that are assigned to them.
   - The following search expressions can be used to show the user relevant projects:
      - Search for Projects (Team Members *contains* Current User)
      - Search for Tasks (Assigned To *contains* Current User) ‘s Related Projects
- Viewing My Tasks filtered by Completion status
   - The user should be able to see Tasks assigned to them and filter the list to view which ones are completed, which ones are due, and which ones are overdue.
   - The following search expressions can be used to show the user their tasks with various filters:
      - Completed Tasks: Search for Tasks (Assigned To *contains* Current User; Completed Date *isn’t empty*)
      - Upcoming Tasks: Search for Tasks (Assigned To *contains* Current User; Completed Date *is empty*; Due Date > Current Date/Time)
      - Overdue Tasks: Search for Tasks (Assigned To *contains* Current User; Completed Date *is empty*; Due Date < Current Date/Time)

 Project Management Apps

*By Airdev, creators of the Canvas building framework*

*Various members of the Bubble ecosystem contributed these use case-oriented database guides. There's always more than one way to do something in Bubble, but the advice here can help you get started if you're new to Bubble!*

Project management applications help teams coordinate their efforts to get more done together. The classic setup involves breaking projects into individual tasks, each of which has an owner and deadline. Team members can update and track task statuses as they work toward completing everything on time. More complex setups can involve goals, milestones, subtasks, and other more sophisticated structures. The category has proven to be a natural fit for a web application, since multiple team members need to access and update the same information. Popular examples include Asana, Monday, JIRA, Trello, Wrike, and ClickUp.

Though the content below focuses on the data structure that supports the application under the hood, the user experience for a project management app is generally meant to be less linear (e.g., like an ecommerce website) and more free-flowing as users toggle between projects and tasks to collaborate and get things done. The app may include some of the following pages:

- A homepage and supporting marketing pages to entice and inform potential users
- A login page where users can enter credentials to access their portal
- A personal dashboard, where users can manage their profile, teams, and get an overview of the tasks they are assigned (i.e., their to-do list)
- A team workspace, where users can manage a team’s settings, members, and projects
- A project board, where users can manage the tasks under a project (usually as a list, board, or table)
- An account settings page, where users can update their credentials and technical settings
- An admin dashboard, where app owners can access key metrics, users, and other key data objects to manage their platform

Data types recommended

The primary data object in a project management tool is the Task, which is something that needs to be done by someone (i.e., a User) by a deadline. In order to help Users find, organize, and complete tasks on time, project management tools typically organize them into distinct Projects, each of which has a set of Tasks. Projects can also exist within Teams, each of which has a set of member Users and Projects. Thus each User can see their own Teams, the Projects within them, and the Tasks within those.

User

An individual team member who can login to access their projects and tasks.

Suggested fields on this type

- Email (text): the email address the user signs up with
- Name (text): alternatively, you can separate first and last into two fields, and have a third representing full name
- Profile picture (image): a nice mugshot to be displayed with their profile
- Role (Role, an option set): role within the application (member, admin)
- Teams (list of Teams): a list of teams the user is a part of (i.e., who’s projects they can access)

Suggested privacy rules on this type

- Users on the same team can access one another’s info
- Admins can access any user’s info
- Everyone else can’t find or access any user info (since each team is a closed system)

Team

A group of individual users who work together on a set of projects and tasks.

Suggested fields on this type

- Name (text): each team can have a name (e.g., Dunder Mifflin)
- Owner (User): the team member who can edit the team, add/remove team members (this might start with the team’s creator, but the distinction could be transferred to someone else)
- [Members (list of Users)]: this is optional since each User has a list of teams they are a part of – sometimes it’s helpful to [link both ways](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/structuring-an-application/data-structurconnecting-types) to simplify search expressions in the app, as long as you keep both directions in sync (try a database trigger for that)
- [Projects (list of Projects)]: another optional linkage, since each project has a team

Suggested privacy rules on this type

- Users can access teams they belong to
- Admins can access any team’s info
- Everyone else can’t find or access any team info (since each team is a closed system)

Project

A single initiative (represented by a collection of tasks) to be completed by a team.

Suggested fields on this type

- Name (text): each project can have a name (e.g., Public Launch)
- Team (Team): the team that is working on the project
- Owner (User): this might be helpful for tracking (i.e., where do Michael Scott’s projects stand?)
- [Tasks (list of Tasks)]: this is an optional linkage, since each task has a project
- [Completed tasks (number)]: sometimes it’s helpful to pre-calculate a count of tasks for the project to make it easier to download project data and display metrics without lots of search expressions
- [Total tasks (number)]: see explanation above – completed / total allow you to calculate percent completed

Suggested privacy rules on this type

- Users can access projects within teams they are a part of
- Admins can access any project’s info
- Everyone else can’t find or access any project info (since each team is a closed system)

Task

A single action item within a project, assigned to someone from the team, with a deadline and status that can be tracked to completion.

Suggested fields on this type

- Title (text): the high-level name of the task (e.g., “Purchase party hats”)
- Description (text): a long-form description of the work to be done
- Attachments (list of files): any images or files relevant to the task
- Assignee (User): the team member responsible for the task
- Deadline (date): when the task is due
- Status (Status, an option set): the current stage in the process the task is in
- Project (Project): the initiative the task is a part of
- [Team (Team)]: this is an optional linkage because the task’s project will be associated with a team, but sometimes it’s easier to create the direct link to make privacy rules easier
- Watchers (list of Users): any team members who want to be notified of changes to the task (e.g., the assignee’s manager)
- Tags (list of Tags, an option set): any labels the task fits into (makes filtering tasks easier)

Suggested privacy rules on this type

- Users can access tasks within teams they are a part of
- Admins can access any task’s info
- Everyone else can’t find or access any task info (since each team is a closed system)

Option sets recommended

Role (users)

- Member
- Admin

Having an option set for high-level application roles is useful for any application. In this case, it helps to separate standard users from administrators. This will affect what data the user has access to, and whether they work within their team workspace or an admin dashboard. Note: this is different than team-based roles or project-based roles. In this MVP setup, we’ve assumed each has a single owner, but you could use a separate option set to define roles at those levels.

Status (tasks)

- New
- To do
- Doing
- Done

Assuming you want to use the same set of task statuses across the application, it will be easiest to use an option set. This makes it easier to adjust the list later without disrupting existing data. Note: if you want to allow for custom statuses by team or project, you would move these to a data object so they can be edited on the fly from within the app.

Tag (tasks)

- Urgent
- Bug
- Feature
- etc.

Assuming you want to set the tags that tasks can be labeled with across the application, it will be easiest to use an option set. Note: if you want to allow for custom tags by team or project, you would move these to a data object, for the same reason as for statuses above.

Example uses in your app

- On the personal dashboard, searches may include:
- My tasks: Search for Tasks where Assignee = Current User and Status <> Done, Sorted by Due Date (ascending). This will start with overdue tasks (i.e., with due dates in the past) and proceed to nearest upcoming tasks.
- My teams: With the data structure above, this can be done directly as Current User’s Teams (using the list field). Alternatively, it can be done as Search for Teams where Members includes Current User (this condition isn’t strictly needed since privacy rules will only allow a user to see their own teams, but it can be helpful anyway).
- On the team dashboard, searches may include:
- Projects: This can be done directly as This Page’s Team’s Projects (using the list field). Alternatively, it can be done as Search for Projects where Team = This Page’s Team.
- Members: This can be done directly as This Page’s Team’s Members (using the list field). Alternatively, it can be done as Search for Users where Teams includes This Page’s Team.
- A selected Project’s tasks: This can be done directly as Parent group’s Project’s Tasks (using the list field). Note: “Parent group” assumes you’re showing the list within a group that has a data type = Project, which you change the value of when a user selects a project. If you are using a board/Kanban view, you may have a repeating group of lanes/statuses, where the data type is the Status option set and each cell has a search for tasks with that status.

Additional notes

Project management software can get very feature-rich in order to satisfy the needs of the broadest range of teams and projects. In addition to the basic structure above, below are a few common features you may want to include in your database structure:

- The ability for users to post comments within a task to collaborate
- Custom fields on a task, either at the team or project level
- A history of updates for a task (e.g., status changes, edits to name/description, reassignment, deadline shifts)
- Custom statuses / tags for each team or project (as described above)
- Subtasks (i.e., the ability for tasks to be nested under one another)

Project management tools are sometimes white-labeled, so each team can have their own copy on their domain. Bubble supports this through their “sub-app” feature. If you take this approach, you can create the app assuming just one team, and create a copy for each team.

 CRM Apps

By Petter Amlie, founder of Amlie Solutions

*Various members of the Bubble ecosystem contributed these use case-oriented database guides. There's always more than one way to do something in Bubble, but the advice here can help you get started if you're new to Bubble!*

In this example, we are building a CRM or Customer Relationship Management software. This is used by organizations to keep track of their clients, vendors and contacts.

Well-known CRM examples are Salesforce, Insightly, Zoho CRM and SuperOffice. We’re going to set up a CRM that allows multiple clients to work in the same software without seeing each other’s data (typically called a SaaS model), and this will be reflected in some of the ways we structure the Data and Privacy Rules. What this means in practice is that I, as a paying client, will only have access to see and make changes to my own data, and I can trust that nobody else has access to my data.

Additionally, the way we set it up allows for multiple Users for each client, since the client will typically be a company itself. This way, an account owner can invite their team into your CRM platform to collaborate on sales processes and customer management.

Data types recommended

We’ll be working with a fairly simple set of Data Types to show the principles behind the multi-client CRM model. This could easily be extended with more Data Types (such as Deals, Projects, Tasks and Meetings) using those same principles. Most Contacts and Companies added to the platform will start their life-cycle as a Lead, that then becomes a Contact and/or Company as it moves through the sales process.

ParentOrganization

The ParentOrganization is the organization that your app’s Users belong to. For example, I might register as a company called Acme Inc. and add all my 25 employees to that ParentOrganization. Those 25 employees will then have access to only data that belongs to their ParentOrganization, and nothing else. To make this happen, we need to add the ParentOrganization to all other Data Types and set up Privacy Rules for each of them.

The ParentOrganization is created when the first user in that organization registers in your application, and then that User invites their team to that organization.

In principle, this organization only needs a name; we can set up the Data Type as below:

Suggested fields on this type

- Name (text)
- Owner (User) - this will be the User who first registered the account and is the owner, or admin, of it

Privacy Rules

As we explored earlier, the ParentOrganization makes up the primary security “fence” of your application: all Users should only be able to access data that belongs to their ParentOrganization. This also means that we need to keep the ParentOrganization itself private: Users outside of my organization shouldn’t even know that we have an account. So let’s set that up like this:

If this ParentOrganization is Current User’s ParentOrganization, this User can:

- View all fields: yes
- Find this in searches: yes
- View attached files: yes
- Allow auto-binding: no

Ok, so that Rule lets only Users who belong to that ParentOrganization to see its details, but note that we’re blocking access to edit it. But remember, when the Organization is first set up, we also set up a field for Owner. That particular User should be able to make changes to their own organization. That would look like this:

If this ParentOrganization’s Owner is Current User’s ParentOrganization, this User can:

- View all fields: yes
- Find this in searches: yes
- View attached files: yes
- Allow auto-binding: yes

Notice the last rule in bold: since this User is the owner of the ParentOrganization, we’ll allow that User to make changes to it.

Company

Now we move on to the actual data that your Users will store in the CRM. A Company is any organization that you add to your CRM that’s not your own. A Company can be both a Client and a Vendor, as separated by the Company type field. We have added a few standard fields like phone number and address, and you can of course add as many more as you need to store more information.

Suggested fields on this type

- ParentOrganization (ParentOrganization) - connects this to the entity who owns this data and thus should be allowed to see it; see [this article](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/structuring-an-application/data-structurconnecting-types)​
- Name (text)
- Address (Google Maps address)
- Phone (text)
- Website (text)
- Type (list of Company Types, an option set) - note that this is a list of Company Types. If you add just Client to that list, then the Company can be sorted as a Client, and the same if you add Vendor. However, since we’re using a list here, you can add both Client and Vendor, allowing a Company to be both.

Privacy rules

Since we set up our ParentOrganization in the last step, we now need to make sure that the Company type we’ve created is only available to Users who belong to the Organization to which it was added:

If this Company’s ParentOrganization is Current User’s ParentOrganization and Current User’s ParentOrganization is not empty, this User can

- View all fields: yes
- Find this in searches: yes
- View attached files: yes
- Allow auto-binding: yes

So, our rule says that the Company belongs to a ParentOrganization, and so does the User: as long as these two match, that User can see and edit the Company. Take note of the second condition we’ve added: and Current User’s Organization is not empty - this is an extra level of security that will stop Users from seeing Companies if both the ParentOrganization of the Company and the User is empty (in which case they will technically match). This should never happen, of course: but since software bugs do occur sometimes, this gives us an extra layer of security even in the unlikely case that both the User’s ParentOrganization and the Company’s ParentOrganization is somehow lost or deleted.

Contact

In many cases when you add a Company to your CRM, you’ll also want to add Contacts to that Company. A Contact needs to contain information similar to what you would save in your phone’s phone book. A Contact doesn’t have to belong to a Company, but if they do we can use that field to filter and sort Users in our platform:

Suggested fields on this type

- ParentOrganization (ParentOrganization)
- Company (Company) - the custom Data Type above
- First name (text)
- Last name (text)
- Phone (text)
- Email (text)
- Address (Google Maps address)
- Date of Birth (date)
- LinkedIn Profile (text)

Privacy Rules

The Privacy Rules for a Contact are similar to a Company: Users should only be able to see Contacts that belong to their own ParentOrganization. Let’s set it up like this:

If this Contact’s ParentOrganization is Current User’s ParentOrganization and Current User’s ParentOrganization is not empty, this User can:

- View all fields: yes
- Find this in searches: yes
- View attached files: yes
- Allow auto-binding: yes

Lead

A Lead is a bit different from Contacts and Companies in that they are more temporary. They are basically potential clients: you don’t know whether they will convert to an actual client yet, and your Users may not want to store them as a Contact just yet to avoid overflooding the database with irrelevant Contact and Company records. A Lead can typically come into contact with your Client using a contact form: they’ll provide their contact information, but it’s too early to say whether they’re serious about doing business

If a Lead does convert into business, we’ll convert it into a Contact and/or a Company. At this point we’ll create the Contact/Company record based on the information saved in the Lead. Optionally, we can delete the initial Lead at that point (unless you want to keep it around)

We’ll introduce a slight change to this Data Type to illustrate what’s possible with Privacy Rules: we’re going to assume that if this Lead was created by an employee, we want only that employee to be able to edit it. We’re going to use the built-in Created by field for that.

Suggested fields on this type

- ParentOrganization (ParentOrganization)
- First name (text)
- Last name (text)
- Company name (text)
- Phone (text)
- Email (text)
- Comment (text): if you are generating leads from a contact form, a comment field is a great way to save what kind of interest the lead has in your company.

Privacy Rules

For this one, we’re actually creating two Privacy Rules. One is to make the Lead visible to all members of the same ParentOrganization (like we did with the other Data Types), and the second rule is to let the Lead’s Creator be the only one allowed to make changes to it:

If this Lead’s ParentOrganization is Current User’s ParentOrganization and Current User’s ParentOrganization is not empty and this Lead’s Created by is not Current User, this User can

- View all fields: yes
- Find this in searches: yes
- View attached files: yes
- Allow auto-binding: no

If this Lead’s ParentOrganization is Current User’s ParentOrganization and Current User’s ParentOrganization is not empty and this Lead’s Created by is Current User, this User can:

- View all fields: yes
- Find this in searches: yes
- View attached files: yes
- Allow auto-binding: yes

Note like in our ParentOrganization that the only difference is in the final Rule. In plain English, we’re saying that if the Current User created this Rule, then that User should be able to edit it (by allowing auto-bind).

Option sets recommended

For any data that’s shared between all Users of the platform and remains fairly static, we can use an Option Set. Option Sets load faster than data in your database, but they’re not meant to hold any private information.

In our CRM, we’ll use it to store the two types of Companies in our database.

Company Type

- Client
- Vendor

The Company Type Option Set is used to separate Client and Vendor companies. We’re storing the Company Type as a List, which makes it possible to make a Company both a Client and a Vendor.

 Professional Services Apps

*By Chris Strobl, Founder & Co-CEO of No Code Germany*

*Various members of the Bubble ecosystem contributed these use case-oriented database guides. There's always more than one way to do something in Bubble, but the advice here can help you get started if you're new to Bubble!*

Professional services experts spend 80% of their time on back-office tasks. The digitization of business processes around project- and client management, forms & templates, invoicing, scheduling, automation and reporting allows professional services experts to focus on revenue and profitability.

This guide suggests a database setup for an application for professional services firms that handles basic booking and invoice needs. In detail, this app helps manage the lifecycle of an engagement and lets users manage projects, book clients, sign contracts online, send invoices and handle payments.

Data types recommended

A Project represents some unit of work for the professional services firm. Projects are related to Clients that the firm has. The first step in a Project is usually receiving an Inquiry.

User

Every Bubble app comes with the concept of a User. In this case, we assume that the tool is mostly going to be used by employees of the professional services firm, meaning the app is an internal tool for the firm.

Suggested fields on this type

- Name (text): the name of the person
- Admin (yes/no): whether this person is an admin of the tool

Privacy rules for this data type

Since this is an internal tool, in general for all data types, you will want to create a privacy rule so that only users who are logged in can find any data in searches or view any of the fields. This way, nobody external to the company who doesn’t have an account with the tool will be able to see the data. Since this is an internal tool, the app should not have a publicly accessible signup page; instead, for any new employee who needs access to this system, you can manually create an account for them via the App Data tab of the editor.

Project

Whether it is the design of an advertising campaign, the development of an app or the implementation of a consulting project, the core activity of a professional service firm is the implementation of projects.

Suggested fields on this type

- Project name (text): the name of the project
- Hourly rate (number): pricing for invoices
- Client (Client): which Client this project relates to; see [documentation](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/structuring-an-application/data-structurconnecting-types) on connecting data types
- Inquiry (Inquiry): the original Inquiry that this project came from
- Project stage (project_stage): the status of this project, out of a set of options

Privacy rules for this data type

As noted above, you will want a privacy rule to only allow logged in users to find this data type and view its fields. If one of the fields is particularly sensitive (like hourly rate), you could consider creating another privacy rule to only show that to users who have the ‘admin’ field set to ‘yes’.

Inquiry

Prior to starting a project, the client submits an Inquiry via an online form that governs the specifications of the project.

Suggested fields on this type

- Project description (text): you can use a “multiline input” element to give the prospect more space to describe their business problem
- Project type (project_type): one out of a set of options to consider (see below)
- Target budget (number): useful information for you to know as you assess whether to take the project
- Inquiry date (date): information on when the Inquiry was submitted.

Privacy rules for this data type

As noted above, you will want a privacy rule to only allow logged in users to find this data type and view its fields.

Client

Master data about the client is the foundation for a good customer relationship. You can keep building out new features in this app to eventually turn it into a CRM!

Suggested fields on this type

- First name (text)
- Last name (text)
- Email (text): note that Bubble’s database does not automatically enforce uniqueness (i.e. nothing is stopping the app from having two Clients with the same email, yet), but you can implement uniqueness through workflow logic
- Company name (text)
- Number of employees (number): To get a feeling about the budget and service level
- Phone number (text): because this is just stored as text, you may want to do some data sanitization and even validation in the workflows that save this field
- Billing address (text)

Privacy rules for this data type

As noted above, you will want a privacy rule to only allow logged in users to find this data type and view its fields. If any of the fields are particularly sensitive, you could consider creating another privacy rule to only show those to users who have the ‘admin’ field set to ‘yes’.

Option sets recommended

Project_stage

The client relationship can be divided into different stages. This is especially relevant to keep track of activities such as invoicing. The methodology of each Professional Services firm guides the customer along the Project Stages.

- Inquiry
- Qualification
- Proposal sent
- Contract signed
- Project Kick-Off
- Project Delivery
- Project Hand-over
- Invoice sent

Project_type

An option set for project type helps to organize the portfolio of work of a professional services firm.

- Marketplace
- Social Network
- Productivity Tool
- CRM System
- Analytics Tool
- Something Else

Example uses in your app

You will likely have a page (for logged-in users) that shows all current active projects. This page would have a repeating group with a data source that’s a search for all Projects where the project_stage is or isn’t certain stages that you do or don’t want to consider “active”.

With such a list, you may also want to build the capability to filter by certain project_stages or project_types. If you have dropdowns for these, you can update the repeating group’s data source to include a new filter on project_stage or project_type depending on the value of those dropdowns.

 On-demand Apps

*By Zeroqode Team*

*Various members of the Bubble ecosystem contributed these use case-oriented database guides. There's always more than one way to do something in Bubble, but the advice here can help you get started if you're new to Bubble!*

The on-demand type app can be easily associated with startups like Uber, Instacart, BloomThat, etc. Overall, on-demand apps generally contain capabilities for ordering, delivery, and tracking functionality via a map. Customers can order something from the platform and wait for a courier to deliver the items from a restaurant, for instance. Think UberEats, as one example.

The following guide will give some recommendations for data types and option sets when setting up the database of your on-demand app. The target Bubble app will allow users to have a platform where it is possible for restaurants to list their menu with different meals, and for customers to add menu items to a shipping cart and place orders. The drivers will pick the order and deliver it to the customer.

Data types recommended

The main data type is User, of course. Users are picking different Menu Items from a menu to add to their shopping cart in the form of Cart Items, then placing an Order in order to confirm the payment. Meals come from a specific Restaurant. After completing the payment and receiving the Order, the customers are able to leave a Review for the Restaurant they ordered food from.

Restaurant

This data type contains all the details about a restaurant registered on the platform, ranging from its name to its location. It contains all the list of Menu Items the restaurant offers. As the platform begins running, this data type will also track the Orders that users make from this restaurant.

Suggested fields on this type

- name (text): the name of the restaurant, as displayed in the app
- description (text): to store the restaurant description for customers
- approved (yes / no): to store whether or not the restaurant has been approved by the platform, in case you want to hide the un-approved ones
- location (geographic address): to store the geographic location of the restaurant so that it can be displayed on a map
- menu items (list of Menu Items): to store the list of all menu items that are available to buy from this restaurant
- orders (list of Orders): to store the list of orders related to this restaurant
- owner (User): to store the restaurant owner’s information; note this assumes that every restaurant owner is also a user on your platform, but we can show owners of restaurants different pages or information relative to users who are purely shoppers on the platform
- reviews (list of Reviews): to store the list of reviews related to this restaurant, so customers can see the feedback

Privacy rules for this data type

You can create privacy rules to allow only the restaurant’s owner to see certain fields on their restaurant. If the owner has a page to edit their restaurant’s information, you can also [enable auto-binding](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/working-with-data/protecting-datdefining-permissions) for the fields they’re allowed to edit.

Menu Item

This data type stores information about the individual item from a Restaurant’s menu, which can be added by a user to their cart. A Menu Item comes from a specific Restaurant, and for simplicity’s sake, we can implement logic at the workflow level (i.e. not shown in this guide) to make it so that all the Cart Items in a given cart must come from the same Restaurant.

Suggested fields on this type:

- restaurant (Restaurant): to store the Restaurant that offers this menu item
- name (text): to store the name of this menu item, so it is possible to display it
- description (text): to store a description of this meal (optional, but may be handy)
- picture (image): to store a picture of this menu item
- price (number): to store the price of this meal

Privacy rules for this data type

All these fields are ones that aren’t particularly sensitive, so they would likely be visible to all users. However, one nice feature for Restaurant owners might be to enable autobinding for any fields on a Menu Item that is associated with their Restaurant.

Cart Item

This data type is used to add meals to the shopping cart. It stores the information such as the Menu Item (related to a Restaurant) being added to the cart, the total price, quantity, etc. All the Cart Items in a user’s cart will be added to an Order prior to payment. You can also think of a Cart Item like one line item in the user’s ultimate receipt for an order.

Suggested fields on this type

- menu item (Menu Item): this is the item that the user adds to the cart; the user chooses which Menu Item, then the other fields below dictate the quantity they want of that item and the price that comes out to
- quantity (number): to store the quantity of the menu item added to the shopping cart
- total price (number): to store the total price of the chosen quantity of the Menu Item; storing this is useful in case the restaurant changes the price of the item in the future; if it’s stored here, the app will remember how much the item(s) cost at the time of purchase

Privacy rules for this data type

Since users’ shopping carts will be private to themselves, we would create privacy rules to only make any Cart Item findable in searches and all of its fields visible to the creator of the Cart Item.

Order

This data type stores information about orders created on the platform. It contains information about the Cart Items that the user added to their cart, and we can assume that an Order is created during the (successful) checkout process. This data type also will store various information about how the payment works, including the fee the app will take and the amounts that will be paid out to the different parties of the transaction (the restaurant’s cut, driver’s cut, etc.).

Suggested fields on this type

- cart items (list of Cart Items): to store the list of the cart items that are being purchased as part of this order
- restaurant (Restaurant): to save the Restaurant that the meal was ordered from
- delivery address (geographic location): to store the address this order should be delivered to
- courier (User): to store who will deliver this order; note that this means we assume all couriers on our platform will also be Users in the app
- order total price (number): to store the total price for this order
- app revenue (number): to store the platform's cut for each order transaction
- courier fee (number): to store the payment amount taken by the courier as their cut
- restaurant payout (number): to store the total payment amount received by the restaurant for the order
- current status (Status): to store the status of this order; this will be an option set of pre-determined options (see below)
- payment ID (text): if you’re using a platform like Stripe to manage payments, this field can store the unique ID of this payment
- order ID (text): to help all parties manage a particular order, it can be helpful for your app to generate a unique order ID for this order, which would be stored here

Privacy rules for this data type

Orders should only be visible (i.e. findable in searches) to the parties of the transaction - the Users who are either the ones placing the order, who are the couriers delivering the order, or who are the restaurant owners fulfilling the order. Moreover, sensitive fields like payment IDs and the various prices and payouts should have privacy rules set such that only the relevant party can see them.

Review

After the order is completed, users who placed the order can leave a Review. We’ll assume that Reviews are about a particular Restaurant.

Suggested fields on this type

- reviewer (User): to store the User who is writing the review
- restaurant (Restaurant): clarifies which restaurant this review is about
- rating (number): we can use a 0 to 5 scale for ratings
- text (text): any free-form content the user wants to leave as part of the review

Privacy rules for this data type

Reviews for a Restaurant can generally be left public, i.e. they can be found by any User. For the privacy of those writing the reviews, you may want to specifically hide the reviewer field from the public.

User

This data type contains information about the users on the platform. As we have seen above, there are different kinds of Users on our platform - customers, Restaurant owners and couriers. So for now, our User data type will have fields that relate to any of those three types of users; this means that more Users in the database are unlikely to have all the fields filled out, since they are unlikely to be a customer, Restaurant owner and a courier all at the same time.

Suggested fields on this type

- first name (text): self-explanatory; it’s useful to save the user’s first name as its own field so you can easily do things like incorporate their first name into a confirmation email’s greeting
- last name (text): self-explanatory
- is admin (yes / no): it’s often useful to create a field on User to determine whether that user has special privileges with the platform; for example, this can be used to control whether the user can see an admin panel to help manage all orders (useful for your customer support team)
- address (geographic address): to store the address of the user so it can be pre-filled for future orders
- favorite restaurants (list of Restaurants): to store the list of restaurants a customer likes, if you want to build this feature into your platform
- cart (list of Cart Items): this is how we build a ‘shopping cart’ feature - this field stores the list of items added to the shopping cart by the customer, which can then be referenced when the user goes to checkout; after a successful checkout, you can clear this field on User so that they start from an empty cart on their next visit
- driver license number (text): to store the number of the driver’s license for courier users
- driver license picture (image): to store the photo of the driver’s license for courier users
- orders (list of Orders): to store the list of orders the customer made, as an order history
- owned restaurant (Restaurant): to store the Restaurant object in case the current user is a restaurant owner

Privacy rules for this data type

As with many apps, our User data type contains sensitive information that generally should not be available to the public, e.g. last name, address, driver license information, etc. Any such sensitive field should be hidden from view for anybody except the user themselves and perhaps any admin users on the platform.

Option sets recommended

Status

- New
- Accepted
- Found a courier
- Picked up
- Delivered
- Canceled

This option set is used to define the available statuses of an Order. As the order goes through different stages of its life-cycle, various workflows would advance the status of the Order as various updates happen.

Example uses in your app

Let’s assume that our app, now called Eaty, has an admin page where a member of the platform’s team can see all orders:

​

![Image.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FiRj6gHgHZENVjKadSH9c%2Fimage1?alt=media)

​

The main repeating group on the page shows a query of all Orders by default, but note how the other horizontal tabs on the page would show a list of Orders with filters for different Statuses. For each Order on the page, we see various fields about the Order.

Additional notes

After building the basic functionality of an on-demand app, you may want to consider more advanced features. For example, on-demand apps often benefit from a chat feature with the other parties in the order, push notifications to alert users about order status changes, and a live map to track the delivery. Moreover, you may want to create some mobile-optimized pages for those using the app on the go, such as your couriers. Luckily, all these features and more are possible with Bubble.

 Documentation/ CMS Apps

*By Rico Trevisan from Refactoring NoCode*

*Various members of the Bubble ecosystem contributed these use case-oriented database guides. There's always more than one way to do something in Bubble, but the advice here can help you get started if you're new to Bubble!*

Documentation: that thing we should all be making more of, we are always lacking from others, and we never read enough of it.

The challenge of creating a system for documentation is how complex a "simple" thing can be. Luckily, Bubble allows you to grow your system as your needs grow because it's easy to refactor in Bubble.

In this guide we will create a simple blogging system that is beautiful in its minimalism, yet powerful and easy to upgrade.

Data types recommended

Here are the data types I recommend:

- Page (or you could call it Post or Article or Document)
- Block
- Block Type (option set)
- Published Status (option set)

A Page is an individual blog post (or a piece of documentation) which is composed of multiple Blocks. Each of these Blocks have different types which are determined by Block Type. Each Page has a certain Published Status to allow you to have multiple drafts and only publish the ones that are ready.

Page

Page is the anchor of our system. Everything will be built around it. It needs to be "light" enough to make searching through all posts quick. This means the Page has no body; instead, the body is made up of a [repeating group](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/containerrepeating-group) of Blocks instead, as we’ll see below.

Suggested fields on this type

- Title (text): This is the title of the post. It will be used in the landing page with the list of posts, on the page of the post itself, and it will be what search engines will see.
- Slug (text, built-in field): slug is the title transformed into a URL-friendly text field.
- Description (text): The 2 to 3 sentences that give the reader a sneak peak of what's in the post.
- Published Date (date): A date of when the post has been published or of when it is scheduled to be published.
- Status (Published Status, an option set): What controls the visibility of the Page.
- Author (list of Users): Making this a list allows you to have co-authors

​

​

Privacy Rules

A rule for when “This Page's Status is published” should allow anyone to view all fields and find this in searches.

​

![Image.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FDpd11LYz1MJkCRu2SyGj%2Fimage7?alt=media)

​

Otherwise (the default rule), it should not be visible.

​

![Image.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FKI1klE0wpL3XR2PMCKQC%2Fimage8?alt=media)

​

Block

This is the body of each Page.

If we were to create a single gigantic Page with one field called body that houses the entire blog post, each Page would be too heavy to be able to quickly search through them and we would not have a lot of flexibility in how to display the content.

Instead, we think of each Page as a listing of all the Blocks that make up the Page’s contents. We do that by using a Repeating Group that searches for all Blocks that relate to that Page, sorted by the Index.

​

![Image.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FvqjUtF6XjbZuT6BxQeuj%2Fimage3?alt=media)

​

Each row of that repeating group contains all the different ways that Blocks can look, depending on the field called ‘Type’. All these different looks are invisible and collapsed by default, and then only the one that matches that Block’s Type will show up as visible.

​

![Image.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F79xVyA2wVEnf2gRfJYLc%2Fimage5?alt=media)

​

Each block is marked as invisible and collapsed by default.

​

![Image.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F49ttpQ2GBqnPjMDkH6aH%2Fimage10?alt=media)

​

The Block only becomes visible if the current Block Type matches it.

​

![Image.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FyAczpgLtMvWAGpVQYPuK%2Fimage6?alt=media)

​

![Image.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FeD87qBES929OmXquVXgb%2Fimage4?alt=media)

​

This way we have the flexibility of styling each block differently while maintaining visual consistency for all Pages.

Suggested fields on this type

- Page (Page): This links this Block to its respective Page.
- Index (number): Since in this method you will create a bunch of blocks to create a Page, you need a way to order them.
- Content (text): This is the text that this Block will display.
- Image (image): If the block is of a type Image, this is where it will get the image.
- Image Description (text): Most blogs will have a text under an image either clarifying it or giving credit to the original owner. This field is for that.
- Type (_block_type, an option set): This is the field that sets how this block should look on the page

​

![Image.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FdLesfdWJRDyPBTnc6f3I%2Fimage1?alt=media)

​

Privacy rules

We can keep it simple and have this type without many restrictions. The only restriction that might be useful to apply is one that allows an admin to allow auto-binding. In a simple case, we can consider a logged in user as an Admin.

​

![Image.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FNejgR1tqjtQHdfFKmPAM%2Fimage9?alt=media)

​

Option sets recommended

_block_type

- h2
- h3
- body
- image

This is a small set that can get you started putting together content. You could add more visual flare by creating new ways to visualize blocks. Ideas that could help you expand your types of blocks: quote, a note block, an image + text, code block, YouTube video… the possibilities are endless.

Why no H1? Well, the title of the Page should be your h1 and everything else will be children of it.

_published_status

- draft
- scheduled
- published

Simple set of status to manage each blog post.

 Applicant Tracking System (ATS) Apps

*By Tinkso*

*Various members of the Bubble ecosystem contributed these use case-oriented database guides. There's always more than one way to do something in Bubble, but the advice here can help you get started if you're new to Bubble!*

You’ll build an app that helps recruiters manage candidates & track the various steps in the hiring process in a scalable way. An Applicant Tracking System (ATS) includes job postings that can also be publicly available and shareable with potential candidates. Depending on your type of ATS, we will build a foundation that will allow you to create more complex features on top of it. Most ATSs have a built-in notification and communication system that allows recruiters and whole teams to manage large numbers of candidates.

Popular ATS examples are: Jobvite, SmartRecruiters or Workable.

While we’ll focus on data architecture, this type of app is usually made of these elements:

- Forms allowing you to create a new job posting and candidate profiles
- Display and filter a list of applications as well as candidates
- Application detail page containing job details and funnel around current candidates that applied to that position

Data types recommended

Users - who we can think of as recruiters - will be creating Talents (a person who is a candidate for a job) and Job postings. We will automatically create an Application when Users associate a Talent to a Job. Users are grouped into Companies. Each Company can have one or more users and many Talents and Job postings. Note that a Talent can only belong to one Company - if the same real-life person applies to two separate companies, each Company would have its own Talent record for that candidate.

The Application data type allows us to track multiple Talents throughout all the stages of the hiring process. This structure enables you to assign a Talent to multiple Job postings without the need to copy unnecessary data.

Company

The Company data type keeps all Talents, Users and Applications neatly organized in a way that Users from one Company cannot see other Companies and all the data they create. All Talent, Applications and Jobs will be grouped per Company. This will allow us to create an application that can be used by multiple unrelated companies.

Suggested fields on this type

- name - text
- logo - image
- phone - text

Privacy rules for this data type

Current User’s Company is this Company: this user can see all information connected to that Company. This allows a user to see the information about their own Company, but no other Company (the default rule should not show anything).

Talent

A Talent is a profile of a given candidate for a given company. It contains all the necessary details about the applicant.

Suggested fields on this type

- firstName - text
- lastName - text
- fullName - text
- contactEmail - email
- phoneNumber - text
- aboutMe - text
- CV - file
- Tags - list of texts
- Notes - text: additional information from the recruiter about the candidate.
- TalentStatus - option set: when first creating talent we can default to Available. If this talent will be hired, we can update it to Hired status. This field will allow us to manage Talents which have applied to multiple Job positions, and filter that data appropriately.
- Company - data type: Company to which the Talent belongs. In our system, one Talent cannot apply to more than one Company; if the same real-life person applies to more than one Company, they would need separate Talent records for the sake of keeping the data between Companies separate

Privacy rules for this data type

Company data type on the Talent will allow us to create a Privacy Rule: When this Talent’s Company is Current User Company. All of the Talent information should only be accessible to Users to which this privacy rule applies.

Job

Job is a job position to which a candidate applies. It contains all necessary information for the recruiter and candidate if the Job position information is made public.

Suggested fields on this type

- Position - text
- Description - number
- Notes - text: information that should stay confidential, for recruiters only.
- JobStatus - option set: job status will allow us to filter data and manage all the Jobs within the ATS.
- Hired - Application: only one candidate can be hired per position, and when that happens we will update this field with the right Application.
- Company - data type: Company to which the Job posting belongs.
- Optional: Hired Talent - talent data type: you can also store hired talent on the Job to enable database searches like Display list of Jobs connected to this Talent.

Privacy rules for this data type

If your ATS creates job postings which are publicly accessible, you might not want to disclose some information e.g. the Hired field, to non-logged in Users or Users from a different company. You can set the privacy rules as follows:

- When this Job JobStaus is Open: following information is visible on the Job postings page:
- Position
- Description
- When Job’s Company is Current User Company: this user can see all information connected to that Job.

Application

Application combines some information about a Job and a Talent into one data type. It will allow us to track multiple candidates through a recruiting funnel.

Suggested fields on this type

- Job - data type: an application can only exist if it's linked to a Job. Job details page will display all the applications connected to that Job.
- ApplicationStatus - option set: this will allow us to create a candidate pipeline and track all the applications through the recruitment stages. It can also be used to trigger different logic such as ‘Notify the candidate’ or ‘Change the Status of the Application’s Job to Hired.
- Talent - data type: talent that should be considered in this Job’s pipeline.
- Company - data type: for privacy reasons, we need to store to which Company this applications belongs.
- interviewDate - data: can be used to send notifications to a User and Talent.
- Notes - text: additional information from the recruiter about the candidate.
- Rating - number: multiple categories for rating can be created. A simple field that will allow the User to rate the candidate from 1-5 and later filter the applicants for that position to better match possible hires.

Privacy rules for this data type

When Job’s Company is Current User Company: this user can see all information connected to that Job.

User

Built-in Bubble app field. Application user. It’s the recruiter that manages job applications within the app.

Suggested fields on this type

- firstName - text
- lastName - text
- fullName - text
- Email - text
- userType - option set: you can manage permissions within the app based on the userType (e.g. admin recruiter vs basic recruiter)
- Company - data type: company to which this User belongs

Privacy rules for this data type

- When this User is Current User - see all fields.
- When this User type is Admin Recruiter and This User’s Company is Current User Company - see all fields.

Option sets recommended

All of the option sets listed below create flexibility in managing the Talent, Job and Applications within the app. You can easily add new options to create an even better experience for the end-user and allow them to manage the process more granularly.

Job Status

- Open
- Matching
- Hired
- Closed

Job status will allow us to manage a large number of jobs and filter results in searches.

Application Status

- Applied
- Interview
- Rejected
- Hired

Application status will help us track the current state of recruitment for specific positions.

Talent Status

- Available
- Hired
- Not-available

Talent status will help us manage available talent within our application.

Example uses in your app

The main search of the app is based on the Application data type which has information from other data types.

You can set up it up the following way:

- Remember to set the [‘Ignore empty constraints’](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/searcignore-empty-constraints) on the search.
- You can sort either by InterviewDate or Creation Date field.
- The layout of the repeating group will depend on your app’s design. We recommend going either with extended vertical scrolling or introducing pagination for a better User Experience.

 Portfolio Apps

*By Tinkso*

*Various members of the Bubble ecosystem contributed these use case-oriented database guides. There's always more than one way to do something in Bubble, but the advice here can help you get started if you're new to Bubble!*

You’ll build an app that allows people to showcase their work and self-promote their projects. Portfolio apps consist mostly of showcasing your work but many similar apps also serve as a networking site for professionals. Most of the users use it for inspiration so almost all of the data will be publicly available.

Popular examples of portfolio apps are: Dribbble, Unsplash or Behance.

While we’ll focus on data architecture, this type of app is usually made of these elements:

- Form to create a new project
- Search and display a list of projects
- Project detail page
- Personal dashboard listing the projects you have created, liked or bookmarked

Data types recommended

A Project, which is the main data type, is created by a User. A user is able to create as many projects as she/he wants, each of them linked to that creator.

The challenge of this kind of app is to show visitors the projects that match their search, so the filter fields related to the projects are crucial. To keep consistency you might want to prohibit adding Categories, while you allow the creator of a project to create as many Tags as she/he wishes. These Tags will become new filters available to everyone, also available when creating future projects. A logged in user will be able to like a project, which will create a new Like record.

Likewise, it will be possible to build a library of projects using the Bookmark data type.

User

Built-in Bubble app data type. The user can create a Project, bookmark a Project, and like Projects.

Suggested fields on this type

- First name - text
- Last name - text
- Email - text
- Profile picture - image
- Company name - text
- Company logo - image
- Location - geographical address
- Website - text
- Bio - text
- Slug - text: using Bubble’s built-in feature. This helps create some clean shareable profile page links.

Privacy rules for this data type

Since the purpose of the app is to show a user’s work and allow them be contacted, all users' fields are public and without privacy rules. Note that this also means your users’ emails are public too - you may want to make it known to users that this is the case, or later tweak your app to make emails private but still allow the outreach functionality.

Project

Project is where all the information for a project is stored. You can add as many fields as you want to further filter the projects on the “search for inspirations” page.

Suggested fields on this type

- Owner - User: is the creator of this project. We don’t use in-built Bubble’s “creator” field as you may want to transfer the project to another user - Built-in Bubble fields don't allow you to edit them.
- Title - text
- Images - list of images
- Tags - list of Tags: this example assumes you want to allow your users to create and grow the number of tags and so we use a custom data type for these, as highlighted below.
- Made with - option set: on the contrary, use option sets if you do not want to let users modify the list in order to keep the choices ordered. Option sets can be faster when loading pages.
- Download with - option set
- Category - option set
- Main color - text
- Description - text
- Number of views - number: this field allows you to display how many times this page has been seen. Run a workflow each time the page is opened that increments this field: Current page Project’s Number of views + 1.
- Slug - text: using Bubble’s inbuilt feature. This helps create some clean shareable profile page links.

Privacy rules for this data type

For the same reasons as for the previous data type, Project has no privacy rules.

Tag

After being created, users shouldn’t be able to delete this data as long as at least 1 project contains this record.

Suggested fields on this type

- Name - text

Privacy rules for this data type

Public data type.

Like

This data type allows users to like projects. By creating a specific data type for it, it allows you to display the list or the count easily from either a project’s or a user’s point of view, e.g. how many users like a project or how many projects a user has liked.

Suggested fields on this type

- Creator - User - Bubble built-in field that automatically captures the Creator of a data type. You don’t have to do anything in order to set this field when creating it. It’s fine to use the built-in field here because we aren’t planning to let users ‘transfer’ their like to another user.
- Project - Project - The project being liked. Use this field as a constraint to count the number of likes associated with a specific project.

Privacy rules for this data type

Public data type.

Bookmark

Similar to a Like, users can have their own list of bookmarked projects.

Suggested fields on this type

- Owner - User - Bubble built-in field that automatically captures the Creator of a data type. You don’t have to do anything in order to set this field when creating it. Use that field as a constraint when wanting to display to this user his own bookmarked projects.
- Project - Project

Privacy rules for this data type

You can choose either to make it public so that you can display users' collections, or to make it private so that only the user who this list belongs to can see it.

(Apply the following privacy rules if you want to make it private) - This Bookmark’s Owner is Current User:

☑View all fields

☑Find this in searches

☑View attached files

Option sets recommended

All these options have only one purpose: to be able to filter the projects on the search for inspirations page. Create as many set options as you want then add a field with this set option in the PROJECT data type.

For instance, these are inspired by Dribbble’s list of options in its search capabilities.

- Sketch
- Unsplash
- Adobe XD

Example uses in your app

- Show and filter projects: Do a search for Projects and add as many constraints as you need. Make sure to tick the box “Ignore empty constraints” in order to display items even when inputs are empty otherwise the list will be empty. Sort the list by descending Created date (Bubble in-built field) to show newest projects on top.

 Gallery Apps

*By Zeroqode Team*

*Various members of the Bubble ecosystem contributed these use case-oriented database guides. There's always more than one way to do something in Bubble, but the advice here can help you get started if you're new to Bubble!*

Speaking about gallery type of apps will surely lead you to apps like Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, and many others.

Gallery apps often come with features like image management by categories, comment threads for each image, likes/dislikes from other users, and others. We can use Instagram as an example of such an app.

The following article will show the recommended data types and option sets that can be a good starting point when developing the database of your gallery application. An app built with such data types will allow users to efficiently upload, manage and share images in a user friendly way.

Data types recommended

The key data type is GalleryImage, which corresponds to the type of item being displayed in the gallery. Users upload GalleryImages, sort them into Categories and can create Comments on anybody’s Images.

GalleryImage

The key data type that is used in this kind of application. Images can be stored both within the app itself or on third-party storage (to lower the database storage costs).

Suggested fields on this type

- image (image): most important field, where the image file itself is stored
- title (text): a title can help other users better understand the image
- description (text): in addition to the title, a short description can be useful too
- categories (list of Category): stores one or multiple Categories that the image is attributed to

Optional

- favorite (yes / no): lets a user mark certain of their own images as favorites, e.g. so that they can be displayed at the top of that user’s profile page
- Note: if you want to build the feature to allow other users to “like” another user’s image, that would most likely be its own data type and is beyond the basic starting point of this guide; see [this documentation](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/structuring-an-application/data-structurconnecting-types) for guidance
- views (number): saves how many times the image has been viewed by users

Privacy rules for this data type

Assuming this is a public gallery, where anybody can see the images in the gallery, we might not need any privacy rules on image since none of the fields are particularly sensitive. You may want to consider allowing the creator of an image to use auto-binding to modify some of the fields within their control, like the title, description, categories or favorite.

Category

For better image management and UX, our app will be able to assign one or more categories to an image. This is conceptually similar to an “albums” feature or a “tags” feature.

Suggested fields on this type

- name (text): the category’s name
- images (list of images): stores the images assigned to this category
- Note: here we are choosing to both save the assigned categories on an image as well as save the assigned images on a category; this is effectively double-writing the data and this decision comes with its own advantages and disadvantages; see [documentation](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/structuring-an-application/data-structurconnecting-types) to learn more

Privacy rules for this data type

Since this is not sensitive information, we likely do not need privacy rules on this data type.

Comment

Publicly available images often come with a comment thread where any user can leave a comment. This data type stores each comment as its own thing in the database.

Suggested fields on this type

- contents (text): stores the comment text
- galleryimage (GalleryImage): attributes the comment to a specific image in the database
- hidden (yes/no): a useful field to have in case you want the ability to moderate comments

Privacy rules for this data type

Generally our assumption is that all comments can be viewed by anyone, so again we probably do not need privacy rules here. If you want to build a moderation feature, you can create a privacy rule to not find any Comments in searches if ‘hidden’ is yes.

User

All apps come with the User data type. We’ll assume that there are different ‘levels’ of users in this app with different privileges

Suggested fields on this type

- displayname (text): stores the name the user wants to be publicly seen as
- role (User Type): stores whether the user has special permissions like moderator or admin rights

Privacy rules for this data type

User information tends to be sensitive, so privacy rules are a good idea here. You likely want to create privacy rules so that only the user can see their own email address, for example, while the displayname field is what’s public to everyone. If you want admins to be able to see users’ emails too, that would be another privacy rule on User to allow that. You likely also want to hide the role of the user from anybody except themselves, moderators and admins. Note that if you have the role here, you can create privacy rules on previous data types we’ve seen (e.g. the hidden field on Comment) so that moderators and admins can update that field as needed.

Option sets recommended

Category

- Fashion
- Cars
- Sport
- Health

You can extend this list to include any categories that fit your app and audience. It is also a decision you have to make as the app creator whether to have Categories as an option set or a data type - [here](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/structuring-an-application/option-setoptions-vs.-custom-types) is some documentation to help you with that choice.

User Type

- Admin
- Moderator
- User

This option set is used to define the available user types. Different user types can have different permissions in the app.

Example uses in your app

- On the homepage of the app, you could show all images in the gallery by using a [repeating group](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/containerrepeating-group) doing a simple search for GalleryImage with no filters.
- For each user’s profile page, you can fill a repeating group with a search for all GalleryImages with the filter that the creator is the [page’s user](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/working-with-data/displaying-datdefining-a-pages-thing)​
- When you ‘click into’ a GalleryImage, you might have [a page that just features that one GalleryImage](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/working-with-data/displaying-datdefining-a-pages-thing) with a repeating group that is filled with a search of all Comments where the galleryimage is the GalleryImage of the page

Additional notes

To make your app attractive, it would be nice also to integrate the possibility of image editing, adding short videos like Tik Tok, as well as receiving push notifications and following/unfollowing other users.

The suggested data types and option sets are just a recommendation, so feel free to build your app in your own style!

 Online Store / Ecommerce Apps

*By Petter Amlie, Amlie Solutions*

*Various members of the Bubble ecosystem contributed these use case-oriented database guides. There's always more than one way to do something in Bubble, but the advice here can help you get started if you're new to Bubble!*

In this guide we’re building an online store, similar to something like Amazon or Shopify: a place where Users can add Products or Services to a Shopping Cart and go through a checkout process where they pay for the items.

For an eCommerce store, no matter what you are selling, there will be a mix of public and private data. For example, Products need to be public, because Users must be able to search for them and add them to their Cart. But a User’s shopping history must only be visible to that User, and to the employees who are fulfilling the order. For this, we’ll use Privacy Rules, and you’ll see that you have full control over who can see what in your application.

We’ll also take into account that you need to retain some historical records at the time of purchase. This is to make sure that Products that may change over time (such as the price being adjusted) does not affect past purchases.

Data types recommended

There will be four major Data Types involved in our online store. The User is of course built into Bubble already, but we’re making some key changes to them to make sure we can separate different types of Users from each other. The second is the Product. This one is a public data type that people can search for and review its details before adding it to our third data type: the cart. The cart is the container that holds Products while the User is shopping, and it allows the User to pay for all items at the same time, as well as maintaining the Users purchase history by showing each Cart as a separate order.

Finally, we’re setting up a Cart item Data Type. We use this item to store information after the purchase has been made to make sure we know what each item cost and how it was described at the time of purchase.

Let’s have a look at the details.

User

Your app will of course consist of Users. In our case, there will be two types of Users that we need to think about:

- Regular Users (users who have registered an account in your application)
- Admins Users (users who have access to your application's back-end to fulfill orders)

Suggested fields on this type

- Name - text
- Phone number - text (if relevant to your app)
- Shopping cart - Shopping cart: This field will be used to store the currently active Shopping cart that the User can add Products to
- Admin - yes/no: This field will be used to determine whether the User is an administrator or not. You can set this field’s default value to “no”

Privacy rules for this data type

In most online stores, we do not want Users to be able to see each other’s cart and we also want to keep it hidden that a User is registered at all, except to the User themselves and Administrators.

Our first rule will let Users see and edit their own information:

If this User is Current User, this User can:

- View all fields: yes
- Find this in searches: yes
- View attached files: yes
- Allow auto-binding:
- Name: Yes
- Phone number: Yes
- Cart: No
- Admin: No

As you can see, Users can now edit all their own information except for a few key fields: The Admin field (since otherwise that would make any User able to set themselves up as an administrator) and the Cart field (since the platform needs to be programmatically in control of that field as the User navigates the shopping process).

Ok, so the User is all set up to handle their own info. As we discussed, we also need a kind of Administrator User that maintains the platform and fulfills orders. We set up the admin field to handle separate those Users, so let’s set up the Privacy Rule as following:

If Current User’s admin is yes, this User can:

- View all fields: yes
- Find this in searches: yes
- View attached files: yes
- Allow auto-binding: yes

With this rule, we’ve made sure that admin Users can find, see and edit all information on all Users, and even assign the Admin role.

Finally, the most important rule is the one that dictates what every User not covered by the previous rules can see and do. In our case, we want to restrict their access.

Everyone else:

- View all fields: no
- Find this in searches: no
- View attached files: no
- Allow auto-binding: no

Product

As your Users navigate your Online Store, they’ll need to be able to find and view Products. You can of course add as many details to this Data Type as you need. For this example, we’ll set up just a simple product with a name, image, price and a short description.

To illustrate how you can use Privacy Rules to hide only specific fields on a database Thing, we’ll also add a field called Profit margin. This is a field that should be available to Administrators, but it should be invisible to everyone else. You may not need this in your app, but we’ll set it up just to learn how it’s done.

Suggested fields on this type

- Name - text: the name of the Product, such as “Coffee mug”
- Image - image
- Price - number
- Description - text
- Profit margin - number

Privacy rules for this data type

First, we need to make sure that Users can see all the Products - if not, it wouldn’t be much of a shopping experience! But keep in mind what we discussed earlier: we don’t want the Users to be able to see the Profit margin unless they are an admin. Also, regular Users should not be able to edit the Products in any way.

We don’t actually need to set up a specific field for Users that are not admins, since in this case, we’ll cover that with the everyone else rule. First, we’ll set up the admin, and then everyone else. Admins should be able to find and edit all Products, and they also have access to the Profit margin field:

If this User’s admin is yes, this User can:

- View all fields: no
- Name: Yes
- Image: Yes
- Price: Yes
- Description: Yes
- Profit margin: Yes
- Find this in searches: yes
- View attached files: yes
- Allow auto-binding: Yes
- Name: Yes
- Image: Yes
- Price: Yes
- Description: Yes
- Profit margin: Yes

Everyone else:

- View all fields: no
- Name: Yes
- Image: Yes
- Price: Yes
- Description: Yes
- Profit margin: no
- Find this in searches: yes
- View attached files: yes
- Allow auto-binding: No

Shopping cart

This is the container that we’ll use to store every Product that the User adds to it both before the purchase is made and after.

Suggested fields on this type

- Products - list of Products: Make sure to check the “This field is a list” on this field to make sure it can contain more than one Product
- Total cost - Number: This is where we’ll store the total amount for all Products in the cart
- Cart items - list of Cart items: Make sure to check the “This field is a list” on this field to make sure it can contain more than one Cart item
- Fulfillment status - Fulfillment status (option set): This field is used internally to determine how the order is moving in the system. You can set the default value for this to “Received” (see notes on the Option Set further down)

Privacy rules for this data type

Like the User itself, the Cart is a very private field: no one except for the customer and the staff managing your app should be able to see it. First, we’ll set it up so that the User can see their own Cart. We’ll use the built-in Created by field for this. There are no fields that are auto-bound on the Shopping cart, since we’ll be relying on Workflows to add and remove items.

If this Shopping Cart’s Created by is Current User, this User can:

- View all fields: Yes
- Find this in searches: yes
- View attached files: yes
- Allow auto-binding: No

Now for the admins that fulfill the order:

If Current User’s admin is yes, this User can:

- View all fields: Yes
- Find this in searches: yes
- View attached files: yes
- Allow auto-binding: yes
- Fulfillment status: yes
- Total cost: No
- Products: No
- Cart items: Yes

As you can see, not all fields are editable, even by an admin. As the total cost is calculated based on the Products inside, we don’t want anyone to be able to edit it directly.

Now again, for the most important rule: what everyone else can see:

Everyone else:

- View all fields: no
- Find this in searches: no
- View attached files: no
- Allow auto-binding: no

Cart item

The Cart Item is basically a clone of the Product at the time of purchase. This lets us store a permanent record of what the item cost and how it was described when it was bought, so that we can make changes to a Product without it affecting already completed carts.

Suggested fields on this type

- Shopping cart - Shopping cart: The Shopping cart to which the cart item belongs.
- Product - Product: First, we’ll link to the original Product
- Price - number: This number we’ll copy from the original Product when the User checks out
- Name - text
- Description - text

Privacy rules for this data type

The Cart items should behave just like the Cart its in: visible to Users and Admins, and invisible to everyone else.

If this Cart Item’s Created by is Current User, this User can:

- View all fields: Yes
- Find this in searches: yes
- View attached files: yes
- Allow auto-binding: No

Now for the admins that fulfill the order:

If Current User’s admin is yes, this User can:

- View all fields: Yes
- Find this in searches: yes
- View attached files: yes
- Allow auto-binding: no

Keep in mind that we may allow Admins to delete items in the Cart, but for that we’ll rely on workflows - not auto-binding. That’s why we keep auto-bind disabled for now.

Option sets recommended

Fulfillment status

- Received
- Processing
- Sent

This Option Set is used to determine where in the system the order currently is, so that you can see which orders have been fulfilled or not. You can of course rename or add as many options as you see fit for your business.

Additional notes

Keep in mind for this guide that it takes a very general approach to Shopping Carts: you may have entirely different needs depending on whether you are selling t-shirts, takeaway food or hotel stays: but the principle remains the same. You need a cart for the User to organize whatever they are buying, and you need to maintain some historical data for what exactly they bought. You are of course free to use the guide as a basis for your own system and add whichever fields you think makes sense. But keep in mind that privacy is key, and that Privacy Rules are the only way to truly keep data secure.

 Blog Apps

*By Jason K (Founder of*  *​*[*www.NoCodeMinute.com*](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nocodeminute.com&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1648861627990551&usg=AOvVaw0ckcz5vI3MhmPLcI9hPveX)*)*

*Various members of the Bubble ecosystem contributed these use case-oriented database guides. There's always more than one way to do something in Bubble, but the advice here can help you get started if you're new to Bubble!*

Many websites use a blog to promote their product, keep their users engaged and display updates about their business. If you are new to Bubble, and web developing in general, you might be struggling to put together the database for it. In this article, we will discuss a few different options to match your skill level and scale requirements. Building a blog with complexity might be more difficult than you might think. Let’s check out some options to help you on your no-code journey!

We will go over two options for your data structures for two different levels of how complex your blog will be - we will call them Basic and Scalable. You can choose which data structure you will want to follow according to your needs. There is always more than one way to do something. Here are just a few ideas.

Data types recommended - Basic example

This example is for a basic blog that doesn’t go into much detail. This is not recommended at scale for large blogs but will be fine for a small blog if you are just starting out. Simple design and easy to set up. Great for beginners if you are trying to just set up your first blog.

As a site owner you will add your blog information into this main data type allowing for it to be displayed on a blog page.

blogPost

This will be your main data type. This will hold the majority of your data and will normally be displayed in a repeating group on your page. Notice how we don’t pluralize the name here since each one (each “thing”) will be a singular blog post.

Suggested fields on this type

- title (text): This will be the title of your blog post.
- summary (text): This will be the summary of your article that will be displayed underneath the title
- byLine (text): The name of the person who wrote the article
- content (text): The content of your blog post; here we can use the Rich Text Editor plugin to add images and formatting, but even the resulting rich text can be stored as a “text” by Bubble
- visible (yes/no): This will allow you to turn posts on or off from being visible on your blog

Privacy rules for this data type

We will assume that you want the Blog to be public, so we will keep the data type and all its fields public. When creating the data type, make sure not to check the box to make it private. Similarly, after creating it, there will be no need to create privacy rules for it.

Data types recommended - Scalable example

This example is for an intermediate blog where posts can have more detail and flexibility. As an example, this allows for each blog post to have a different structure to it instead of one standard structure. This should allow for better scaling. This is great for more experienced users if you are trying to just set up a more professional blog.

This data type allows you to break out the blog post and blog post content separately. The site owner will create a blog post and then add the blog content as a [repeating group](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/containers%23repeating-group&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1648861627993289&usg=AOvVaw3pxBPBMIFlC-6Oq0iWZ3VU) within that blog post. This allows for different blog structures as your users view the different blog posts.

blogPost

This will be your main data type. This will hold the majority of your data and will normally be displayed in a repeating group on your home page. Notice how we don’t pluralize the name here since each one will be a singular blog post.

Suggested fields on this type

- title (text): This will be the title of your blog post.
- summary (text): This will be the summary of your article that will be displayed underneath the title
- byLine (text): The name of the person who wrote the article
- blogContentList (list of blogContents): This is a list of your blogContent data type (see below)
- visible (yes/no): This will allow you to turn posts on and off from being visible on your page

Privacy rules for this data type

We will assume that you want the Blog to be fully public so we will keep the data type public, similarly to the Basic example.

blogContent

This is your content for the blog post. It will hold the body and images of each post’s content. This allows for the flexibility of different structures in the blog content: this data type enables you to store each section of the post’s content as an individual blogContent, which then lets you display the different sections with different formatting. For example, perhaps you want one paragraph (which would be its own blogContent) to be formatted left-aligned, whereas you want the following paragraph (which would be another blogContent) to be formatted right-aligned for emphasis.

If you wanted to make your blog even more flexible, you could build on top of this data type to store additional fields like “order” to set the order in which different chunks of content appear on the page, or “expiration” to set a time before/after which that particular chunk of content should appear.

Suggested fields on this type

- parentBlogPost (blogPost): this is how each blogContent knows which blogPost it belongs to
- blogContentType (blogContentType): this is the option set that will help you distinguish which type of content this will be, an image, text of a certain styling, or something else (see below). Having this field allows you to customize how this chunk of blogContent shows up on the page - the page can display this thing differently depending on its blogContentType.
- text (text): this is where your body paragraphs will go. Each will be in its own blogContent
- image (image): this is where an image in your post can be stored

Privacy rules for this data type

We will assume that you want the Blog to be fully public so we will keep the data type public, similarly to the Basic example.

blogLikes

This data type is if you want to have users ‘like’ a post. We could save the list of ‘like’ing users as a list on each blogPost, but this list might be very large eventually and would slow down your app at scale. Hence, we’re creating it as a different data type. ([Here](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/structuring-an-application/data-structurconnecting-types) is a lot more background on this choice.)

Suggested fields on this type

- parentBlogPost (blogPost): this stores which blogPost actually got the ‘like’
- creator (User): this is who liked the post (built in already)

Privacy rules for this data type

This could have privacy rules on it to not share exactly which user(s) liked a post publicly. In this case, we may want to rely on privacy rules on the User data type - we always recommend having privacy rules on User, given it likely stores sensitive information like email addresses. At minimum, one such privacy rule could be when ‘This user is current user’, they can see their own data but their own data should not be public to anyone else. You only need to be publicly allowed to search this data type to get the count.

Option sets recommended

blogContentType

- text
- imageSmall
- imageLarge
- textAlignLeft
- textAlignRight
- textAlignCentered

This option set, used in our Scalable example, gives you the ability to describe what a particular section of blogContent is. In this example, this flexibility then allows you to align different section of a blogPost differently, or display an image in a large vs small format. You could add other options in this set if you want even more different ways for a chunk of content to appear.

Example uses in your app

- Do a Search for BlogPosts - This would help you display your main blogPosts on your home page when this query [powers](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/containerdata-source-1) a repeating group. For a result in this list - each of which would be one cell of a repeating group - the user would likely be able to click on a link to be taken to that particular blogPost with all of its blogContent.
- Do a Search for BlogContent where parentBlogPost = Current Page’s blogPost - On a [page that’s showing a particular blogPost](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/page-element), this query will pull up all the blogContents for that blogPost, which can then be displayed in a repeating group on the page. Since we are also saving the blogContent as a list on the blogPost, you can access it by saying Current page blogPost’s blogContentList as well.

 Messaging App

*by Rémi Fossembas from Apeable an official Bubble coach*

*Various members of the Bubble ecosystem contributed these use case-oriented database guides. There's always more than one way to do something in Bubble, but the advice here can help you get started if you're new to Bubble!*

Instant messaging apps include ones like Messenger, Whatsapp or Slack. This is a chat application that enables users to instant message and connect with each other. Users send text messages, images, videos, links or files to each other, and other users can reply and react with emojis.

This guide’s data structure and logic can be used:

- as a stand-alone app whose purpose is to connect people with each other. By pushing it to a new target population, you will be able to take a slice of the communication market
- or as an additional feature of your app. This module will ease communication between your users and make your app more fun

These suggested data types and option sets should help you build common functionality for messaging apps in a way that keeps things scalable. Preview this messaging app’s data structure by following this link: [Messaging app](https://bubble-appmessage.bubbleapps.io/version-test/messaging_app)​

Data types recommended

To connect with each other, users (USER) will create channels (CHAT-CHANNEL) with one another (or with groups). When a user presses the “Send” button a new message (CHAT-MESSAGE) is created to store the value of this message, which can be text, images, who has seen it, etc. Someone in the channel may want to react to this message by selecting an emoji which will create a (CHAT-REACTION) stored as a list into the message’s record.

We’ll also cover the feature allowing you to create a list of your favorite contact users (CONTACT).

CHAT-MESSAGE

CHAT-MESSAGE is where the visual information of a message is stored in the database. It belongs to a CHAT-CHANNEL so that you can perform a “Do a search for” all messages in a channel to find all of a specific thread. This data is protected by the field VISIBLE BY that allows only users in this list to search, view files and view fields of this message. Everyone else has no access to it.

Suggested fields on this type

- Type (type, an option set): this field is used for identifying what kind of message content it is, also so that we can control how the message is rendered visually. For instance if the message type is “image” you won’t show the text element of the message.

​

![Image.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FAd7nLNxuIFQNdmRCp4Dw%2Fimage6?alt=media)

​

- Value-text (text): this is the content of the message when this message has Type = text. For instance this field will be empty when your message Type = image, but if Type = text it could be “Hello John”. You could also set Type = link to use BBcode, a special way of storing text that allows for rich text content like links or formatting, for example, “Look at this nice car: [url=https://tesla.com/][Tesla.com](http://Tesla.com)[/url]”.
- Value-image (image): this is the content of the message if this message’s Type is image (or link with a preview).
- Value-file (file): this is the content of the message if this message’s Type is file. The value of this field can be displayed as a link in the text element of the message.
- CHAT-CHANNEL (CHAT-CHANNEL, another data type): is the reference of the thread this message belongs to.

​

- VISIBLE BY (list of USERS): is set for privacy purposes: only users of this list can view this message. Every time a message is created, set this list of users to all users that belong to this chat channel. When a user is added to the channel, add this user to all previous messages.
- OWNER (USER): is often the Current User but that field allows you to create messages on behalf of someone else. It can be useful if you need automated messages sent by a bot for instance.
- SEEN BY (list of USERS): is set to Current User when the message is created, then users are added when they have read the message.

This allows for helpful features like displaying the number of unread messages a user has: Perform a “Do a search for” CHAT-MESSAGE: count, with Constraints:

- CHAT-CHANNEL = XXX
- SEEN BY doesn’t contain Current User
- VISIBLE BY contains Current User (not needed if previous Privacy Rules is set properly)

​

- CHAT-REACTIONS (list of CHAT-REACTIONS): allows users to react to a specific message with Emojis or Likes.

​

​

- CHAT-REPLY (CHAT-MESSAGE): stores the reference of a message that this one was a reply to. In the case where a user wants to reply to a message, you need to store that relationship somewhere. Let's say the original message is A and the reply is B, then save in message B's CHAT-REPLY the message A's value.

Privacy rules for this data type

- Make this data type private by default: uncheck all the boxes under “Everyone else (default permissions)”
- Create a rule:
- When: This CHAT-MESSAGE’s VISIBLE BY contains Current USER, they can “View all fields”, “Find this in searches” and “View attached files”

CHAT-CHANNEL

This Data Type is the primary way to keep messages organized by threads.

Suggested fields on this type

- Name (text): especially useful if threads are organized into channels with a list of Users.
- PARTICIPANTS (list of USERS): is set for privacy purposes: only users of this list can view this channel. Add users to this list so they can see the thread and participate in the conversation.

​

![Image.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FiaVvgLQDlkwrslZ8ivF1%2Fimage13?alt=media)

​

- ARCHIVED BY (list of USERS): allows each PARTICIPANT of the channel to archive a thread but can still unarchive the thread if desired. This data type isn't mandatory for the messaging system to work, but it's an option that allows each user to mute threads and no longer receive notifications.

Privacy rules for this data type

- Make this data type private by default: uncheck all boxes under “Everyone else (default permissions)”
- Create a rule:
- When: This CHAT-CHANNEL’s PARTICIPANTS contains Current USER, they can “View all fields”, “Find this in searches”, and “View attached fields”

CHAT-REACTION

This Data Type allows users to react to a message with some Emojis. This is a separate Data Type instead of a field on CHAT-MESSAGE because multiple users might react to the message, each with a different reaction (emoji). Because we need to store at least two pieces of information about each reaction (the person reacting and their emoji), we can’t store it simply as one field on CHAT-MESSAGE and instead have to use a new Data Type.

Suggested fields on this type

- OWNER (USER): is the creator of this reaction
- CHAT-MESSAGE (CHAT-MESSAGE): the message that the reaction belongs to
- Emoji (Emoji, an option set): this will have choices like 👍 👎 😂 💙

Privacy rules for this data type

- Since this data type alone will not contain information that is too sensitive (since the CHAT-MESSAGE’s contents are not stored with each reaction, just a pointer to the relevant message), we could just leave this visible to everyone

CONTACT

This Data Type allows users to have a list of contacts.

Suggested fields on this type

- OWNER (USER): is the creator of the contact list.
- CONTACT (USER): is the user added to this list.

Privacy rules for this data type

- Make this data type private by default: uncheck all boxes under “Everyone else (default permissions)”
- Create a rule:
- When: This CONTACT’s OWNER is Current USER, they can “View all fields”, “Find this in searches”, and “View attached fields”

USER

Standard built-in Bubble app User.

Suggested fields on this type

- First name (text)
- Last name (text)
- Profile picture (image)
- Email (built-in field)

Privacy rules for this data type

- Make this data type private by default: uncheck all boxes under “Everyone else (default permissions)”
- Create a rule:
- When: Current User is logged in, they should be able to view “First name”, “Last name” and “Profile picture” fields if you want all users to be able to see each others’ information. “Find this in searches” should also be checked if you want users to be able to find each other, such as by name.

Option sets recommended

Type (of CHAT-MESSAGE)

- text
- image
- link
- file
- video

This option set is used for saving what format a message is. This helps when it comes time to build what the page looks like, and you want to render different formats of messages differently. For instance if a message Type is “image” you won’t show a text element of the message.

Emoji

- 👍
- Text: 128077
- 👎
- Text: 128078
- 😂
- Text: 128514
- 💙
- Text: 10084

You can of course add as many emojis you want. You can display them in a text element using the option set’s Display or in a HTML element using the text’s value.

If you want to allow your users to create their own list of reactions, you would use a new Data Type instead of an option set.

Example uses in your app

- Display the list of channels the Current User belongs to: You actually don't need to apply a constraint filter when doing a search with the current user because the privacy rules already ensure that a user can only see channels they are a member of.

​

​

- Display the list of messages of a specific Channel. In the screenshot below, the value of the CHAT-CHANNEL is given by the Parent group that this Repeating Group is in.

​

​

- Display the list of reactions to a specific Message. In this case, the value of the CHAT-MESSAGE is given by the Parent group that this group is in.

​

Additional notes

You might want to allow your users to bookmark some specific messages, like you can on Slack or on Bubble forum, so they can easily access a list of bookmarked messages at any time without having to go through all the threads to find them.

To do so, follow similar logic to how we set up CONTACT, namely a new data type for storing just this information:

- OWNER: (USER) is the creator of the bookmarked message.
- MESSAGE: (CHAT-MESSAGE) is the bookmarked message the owner wants to add to his list.

 Dashboards

*By Robert Brooks, Founder & CEO, MVP.dev*

*Various members of the Bubble ecosystem contributed these use case-oriented database guides. There's always more than one way to do something in Bubble, but the advice here can help you get started if you're new to Bubble!*

In this guide, we will be creating a dashboard for a sales team inside a learning management platform. The dashboard will be in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform that was built in [Bubble.io](http://Bubble.io). This is a central place where sales reps can see their performance and manage their sales activities. The dashboard has different charts and graphs that give insights into the sales process and help reps stay on track with their goals for the day.

Bubble is a great platform for quick dashboard generation. With a good selection of charting plugins, you can easily have your own dashboard stood up for your platform in no time at all.

Data types recommended

The CRM stores common sales data, such as Users, Contacts, Deals, Sales Made, and Chart Data

Users

The users data type stores information about the users of the system – in this case, sales reps, but could include others such as sales managers, SDRS, etc.

Suggested fields on this type

- Email - text
- First Name - text
- Last Name – text
- Role – Roles: Option set that defines the access level the user has to the CRM; privacy rules on many data types will be influenced by this
- Manager – User: This sales reps manager
- And any other fields that might be relevant for platform users

Privacy rules for this data type

- Each user can view all fields for their own data relevant to their own profile, as well as find in searches, and view attached files
- Users with the Manager role can:
- View all fields except the following:
- Slug
- Created Date
- Modified Date
- Find this in searches
- View attached files
- Users with the Admin role can view all fields for all users, as well as find in searches, and view attached files

Contacts

A CRM contact is a customer or potential customer who is associated with a CRM account. CRM contacts typically have detailed information such as name, contact information, and account history.

Suggested fields on this type

- Contact Type – Contact Types: Option set that defines the type of contact this record represents
- First Name - text
- Last Name – text
- Company - text
- Phone Number – number
- Email - text
- Title – text
- Address - geographic address
- Owner - Users: Determines which sales rep owns the record
- Notes - text

Privacy rules for this data type

- Users with the Sales Rep and Sales Manager roles can:
- View all fields for their own data or direct reports data except the following:
- Created Date
- Modified Date
- Find this in searches
- View attached files

Deals

A CRM deal is a type of customer relationship management software that helps businesses manage their customer data. It can be used to track customer interactions, sales, and marketing campaigns. CRM deals can be found online or through software providers.

Suggested fields on this type

- Contact – Contacts: contact record for this deal
- Name - text
- Description – text
- Amount – number
- Stage – Stages
- Date - date

Privacy rules for this data type

- Users with the Sales Rep and Sales Manager roles can:
- View all fields for their own data or direct reports data except the following:
- Created Date

Chart Data

Data to be displayed in the charts on the dashboard. This is usually aggregated data of some sort; sales per month, lost deals this quarter, etc. We store this aggregated data in its own data type so that it’s easier to retrieve this for a chart, instead of having to do the aggregations and calculations when setting up the individual charts.

Suggested fields on this type

- Chart Information – Chart Information: An option set showing the type of data represented by this record
- Number – number
- Date – date
- User – Users: the user this data represents.

Privacy rules for this data type

 Building Block Apps

*By Airdev, creators of the Canvas building framework*

*Various members of the Bubble ecosystem contributed these use case-oriented database guides. There's always more than one way to do something in Bubble, but the advice here can help you get started if you're new to Bubble!*

Using a building-block framework to create your custom app can help to save time and improve quality. The basic premise is to start with a simple base app, pre-configured with standard things like login/admin/account pages, and then add pages and blocks from a library of assets. By piecing these pre-fab’d components together like Lego pieces, you can avoid reinventing the wheel and focus your efforts on the parts of your app that need to be truly custom.

Building-block frameworks can be used to create literally any kind of web application, including:

- Marketplaces and ecommerce stores like Airbnb, Etsy, or Upwork
- Project management, CRM, or productivity tools like Trello, Asana, or Pipedrive
- Social media, forum, or messenger platforms like [Twitter](https://notrealtwitter.com/), Reddit, or WhatsApp
- Analytics & data visualization dashboards to support a process
- Anything else – the world is your oyster!

There are typically a few user experiences that are consistent across platforms (and included in a building-block framework):

- A homepage and supporting marketing pages to entice and inform potential users
- A login page where users can enter credentials to access personalized content (this is often available as a popup too, in case other pages require signup)
- An account settings page, where users can update their credentials and technical settings
- An admin dashboard, where app owners can access key metrics, users, and other key data objects to manage their platform

Below is an overview of the data structure that may be useful in a base template. From there, you will add the data objects and fields that are custom to your app (e.g., connecting a user to their upcoming rentals, or the candidates vying for their gig, or their outstanding projects, or new unread messages).

Data types recommended

The core of any app is the User, which can come preset with data fields that are useful across all app categories. The App settings object is independent from users since it is at the app-wide level, helping to store general variables that could be accessed by different users at different points in their user journey.

User

Someone who can access the application by logging in.

Suggested fields on this type

- Email (text): the email address the user signs up with
- Name (text): alternatively, you can separate first and last into two fields, and have a third representing full name
- Profile picture (image): a nice mugshot to be displayed with their profile
- Role (Role - an option set): role within the application (member, admin)

Suggested privacy rules on this type:

- Users can access their own info
- Admins can access any user’s info
- Everyone else can’t find or access any user info (this can always be opened up later depending on the app’s purpose, but it’s best to start conservative)

App settings

This is a handy way to store all sorts of information about the app itself that you’ll need to reference throughout the app. You’ll only have one entry in this table, since there is only one app. Keeping these in the database rather than hard-coding them in the app allows you to change them on the fly and have the change permeate throughout the app (e.g., if you change your app name from AirBnB to Airbnb).

Suggested fields on this type

- App name (text): the name of the application
- App description (text): a short description of the app, to be used for SEO purposes
- Logo (image): the official app logo (you may want to have a separate field for light/dark versions, or for a favicon)
- Terms (file): the legal terms to be accepted by users (this could also just be a text field)
- Privacy policy (file): same as above
- Primary color (text): the hex code for the app’s primary branding color, which can help dynamically define buttons and other assets

Suggested privacy rules on this type

- Anyone can find and access this record, since its data is often used in marketing pages (i.e., for logged-out users)
- Specific fields may be deemed sensitive and can be protected to just administrators

Option sets recommended

Role

- Standard
- Admin

Having an option set for high-level application roles is useful for any application. This might be buyers vs. sellers, participants vs. owners, or other distinctions (and every app has an admin). This will affect what data the user has access to, and what they can see and do in the app. This is primarily used with the User data type.

Example uses in your app

Examples of data searches will vary widely depending on the use case of the application, but the admin dashboard will likely come preloaded with some key searches:

- New users this week: Search for Users where Date created > Current date/time + -X days : count. Note: other common Users searches include:
- Users waiting for approval (if the app is invite-only)
- Inactive users (no activity in the past X days)
- Users of a certain type (e.g., buyers, sellers, trainers, students)
- To get any app setting: Search for App settings : first item, then use the field of the particular setting you want. This search is trivial because there is only one entry in the database, which contains all the needed fields.

Additional notes

There are building-block frameworks out there that Bubble users have created. Using one of these can give you a jumpstart on building your own application. Selecting a building-block framework to work with involves a certain level of commitment. Below are some factors to consider:

- How many people have used the framework (i.e., social proof)
- How extensive the library of assets is
- How well the library covers the types of features your app is likely to need
- The feature set included with the base application
- How easy it is to learn to use the system, and the level of support you can get
- How its design conventions fit to generally accepted standards

 Bubble as a backend

*By Robert Brooks, Founder & CEO, MVP.dev*

*Various members of the Bubble ecosystem contributed these use case-oriented database guides. There's always more than one way to do something in Bubble, but the advice here can help you get started if you're new to Bubble!*

In this guide, [Bubble.io](http://Bubble.io) will be used as a backend service with an Arduino board to capture sensor data for a pump in a remote area. The module will monitor the pump and receive alerts if the pump fails or if the sensor data indicates a problem, and send the data back via satellite communication. The data captured by the Arduino board will be saved in [Bubble.io](http://Bubble.io) using REST API calls, as well as storing configuration data. The module can also be used to remotely control the pump, turning it on or off as needed.

Bubble is great in these sorts of backend as a service scenarios for quick proof of concept builds, or even production ready solutions. Create the data types and making them available via API is extremely quick and easy

Data types recommended

The Bubble backend solution will be storing configuration information, pump status data, as well as time series data for the historical record of each pump. Data types will be Users, Pumps, Configurations, Alerts, and Pump History

Users

The users data type stores information about the users that have access to the Bubble platform to make configuration changes, turn the pumps on and off, monitor alerts, and view historical data.

Suggested fields on this type

- Email - text
- First Name - text
- Last Name – text
- Role – Roles: Option set that defines the access level the user has to in the database and app; this will be used for the privacy rules of many other data types

 Files

This section covers how Bubble handles uploaded files and images and

Bubble comes with built-in tools both on the editor side and in your app to upload and store files and images.

This feature set can be an important part of your app that comes with different requirements. Some applications need to upload and load public files, such as a photo sharing website or a marketplace with product images. Others need files to be kept as secure as all other data: confidential documents, personal files or employee records for example.

Most applications are somewhere in between: they have some public files and some private files, and some files that change their status based on other criteria (such as a photo showing only if a field on the data type is set to *public=yes*).

In this article, we will look at how you can upload, display/download and delete files, as well as protecting them with Privacy Rules.

**A note on plugins:** Some plugins offer ways of uploading and managing files that may differ from Bubble's built-in features and how they are described here. If you use a plugin to upload and/or manage files, we recommend getting to to know the documentation for the plugin and any third-parties used for file storage, conversion and other external services. The instructions in this article for maintaining file privacy pertain specifically to Bubble's native file management features.

How uploaded files are handled

The Bubble database has two field types that support files: *file* and *image*.

![file-fields@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FfI5hy8chYFzsrdsN5r7a%2Ffile-fields%402x.png?alt=media&token=62ad0cdb-7454-4ff9-8586-5570b6502ee5)

The *image* and *file* fields hold the URLs of uploaded images and other files.

Let's first look at how the mechanics of those features work:

The field in the database does not contain the actual file, but only a URL *pointing* to that file on another server. In other words, the *file* and *image* field types only contain a short string of text: the file's URL.

When you or one of your users upload a file using one of Bubble's built-in tools, it goes through the following steps:

- The file is uploaded to a file storage server
- That server returns a URL to reach that file
- That URL can be saved to the database using a workflow

This logic comes with a few important points to note:

- The size of your file (while important when the file is downloaded) does not affect the size of your database – it only contains the URL as text
- When you delete the content of that field, you are only deleting the URL – not the file
- Files are spread across Bubble's CDN, ensuring a fast download

Managing files in the Bubble editor

Uploading

Files uploaded through the Bubble editor are not protected by Privacy Rules. You should only upload files that are meant to be **public**.

Files can be uploaded directly in the Bubble editor in two ways:

File manager

By navigating to *Data - File manager* you can see and search for all files that have been uploaded. To upload a file, click the *Upload* button in the upper right corner, marked in red in the screenshot below:

![upload-file@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FjMBDPJ1KQ01HuxJ12Ilp%2Fupload-file%402x.png?alt=media&token=f874dd9d-d831-4d1d-b7d3-8fcf24403833)

The file manager lets you update files. Click to enlarge.

The file manager differs between files that were uploaded in Development and Live. Click the link in the upper right corner to switch between the two.

The database manager

When you edit a database thing that has a *file* or *image* field, you can upload a file directly to that field. The file will be uploaded and the URL will be linked to the database thing.

Deleting files

Deleting files in the Bubble editor is done by going to *Data - File manager*. Select the files you want to delete with the checkbox in the list, and then click the *Delete* button in the upper right corner. Keep in mind that Development and Live are separate.

Also note that if you edit a database thing in the database editor and remove the file from it by clicking the *Clear* link, this only removes the URL saved on that thing – it does not delete the file.

![clear-file@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F34WGfbgMhC6Gk3VxwOvw%2Fclear-file%402x.png?alt=media&token=39d795bf-7ff3-47f2-bb78-e7e756393c65)

Removing an image from the database using the *Clear* link does not delete the file, it only removes the URL from the database

Managing files in your app

Uploading

To allow users to upload files, you can choose between two Bubble-native elements:

- File uploader
- Image uploader

The elements both upload files and store their URLs in the database, but each offers a few key differences in their settings:

- **The image uploader**
   - Offers a preview of the image
   - Accepts image formats
   - If an image is larger than 800 x 600 pixels, you can check a box to resize the image to these dimensions
- **The file uploader**
   - Will show the filename and allow the user to download the file with a click
   - Accepts all file types
   - Lets you set a maximum file size in megabytes

If empty, both elements will open the standard operating system file selector.

When a file is uploaded by a user, it's immediately uploaded to the file storage server. This means that as soon as a file is uploaded, it technically has a live URL that can be viewed by anyone with the URL, even if you haven't saved the URL in the database yet.

To keep files private, see how to use Privacy Rules with files below.

Saving the URL in the database

After the file has been uploaded in one of the elements, it's value will return the URL of the image. You then need to use a workflow to save the URL in a field on the relevant data type.

​

![save-image-url@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F7SPLpRmmkHMzyZCIEiS5%2Fsave-image-url%402x.png?alt=media&token=d1947bf2-ac5a-4484-9ad5-75028a4bd3e2)

After uploading the file, you need to save the URL to a field on the user.

Uploading private files

Private files are bound to a database record and shares its Privacy Rules with that data type. For example, if a user uploads a profile photo to their user, that image file will be protected in accordance with the Privacy Rules set on the user data type.

A few additional settings are needed to keep a file private:

Element settings

To set a file to be private, you need to first change some settings on the uploader element:

![upload-private-image@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FetI2ssasjj3XAzkuMCbX%2Fupload-private-image%402x.png?alt=media&token=31d9078b-07b4-4c29-9805-a926a1afb691)

- First, check the box *Make this file private*
- A dynamic field will become visible where you can specify what database thing you want to attach the file to. In this example we have set the *current user.*

These two steps will ensure that the file is uploaded as a non-public file. We then need to check the Privacy Rules on the User data type to control who has access to it.

Privacy Rules

In the beginning of this article we covered that a file upload essentially consists of two parts: the file itself and its URL. This becomes useful and important when we set up the Privacy Rules.

There are two settings that affect the privacy of a file:

- The field in which the file is saved (visible when *View all fields* is unchecked) This setting hides the field in which the URL is saved: in other words, a user without access will not be able to see the URL, but if they were to get the URL somewhere else (for example shared by another user who has access) they would be able to access the file through the URL.
- *View attached files* This setting makes the file itself unavailable to all users who are not authorized to see it. Even if they had the URL, trying to view the file would result in an error message.

It's important to note that the *first* setting alone is not considered a secure way to store a file. Since it's publicly available, anyone could view it if they had the URL, which means the data is *obfuscated* but not secure.

Only by securing the *second* setting (*view attached files*) can you know for sure that no unauthorized users will be able to access it.

Deleting files

If you simply clear a *file* or *image* field on a data type, you only remove the file's URL from the database. To delete the file to free up the space make sure it's no longer available online, you need to set up a specific action:

![delete-file-action@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FE4BWoe6mxOwfsKGwW9ZA%2Fdelete-file-action%402x.png?alt=media&token=ad8fe2bd-b3a9-471a-af1d-dbd9c3d5273d)

The *Delete an uploaded file* action deletes a file that you specify using its URL. In the example above we are deleting a user's profile picture by pointing the action towards the *Current User's Profile image*, which is of type *image*.

Not that you should include an additional step of *Make changes to a thing* and clear out the URL of the file from the *file* or *image* field afterwards, to ensure that it returns an empty value if the file has been deleted.

 Static data

This section covers different ways of saving static data in Bubble

*Static* *data* in Bubble is defined as data that:

- Requires your app to be re-deployed to update
- Cannot be changed by your application's users (unlike dynamic and temporary data)

Static data is typically used to store any kind of structured information that doesn't change regularly, such as:

- Text strings used around the app
- Lists of static choices such as countries, colors and other options
- It can also be useful to save app data like the brand name, legal name, contact information and other pieces of information that you want to to be able to change from one place if necessary

Bubble stores static data in three different ways:

- The data that you **store directly on elements and in workflows**, such as the text on a button or list of texts for a dropdown
- **Application texts**, used to display strings like headers, labels and short texts with the option to offer translated versions
- **Option sets** used to store different kinds of data in a database-like manner

What all three have in common is that they become part of your application's source code. This means that:

- They load very fast, since they are downloaded on page load and don't need to be loaded from the database
- They are cached on the user's device until a new version is deployed, meaning the don't need to be downloaded on each page load
- They are all unencrypted and should never contain any sensitive information

 App texts (translations)

This section covers how to translate your app into multiple languages

App texts, short for *Application texts and messages* is a sort of database for text strings that you can use around your app. It can be used for a single language, but Bubble also lets you translate all the strings into different languages to offer your users a multilingual app.

Application texts are a part of Bubble's *static data* features. This means that they are not dynamic, like the database, and that the app needs to be redeployed every time something changes. As such, they are not meant to store long strings of text like articles and product descriptions, but shorter content like headers, menu options and button labels.

Application texts become part of your application's codebase and is downloaded to every user on page load. You should never use these strings to store sensitive information.

Assigning application texts

Application texts can be used in any expression, meaning that it can be assigned to any element property that accepts dynamic texts: this includes text elements, labels on buttons and checkboxes, text input fields, tooltips an many other places.

​

![CleanShot 2023-09-19 at 13.25.36.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FYXkZqPOScXb0FqThDzEl%2FCleanShot%202023-09-19%20at%2013.25.36.png?alt=media&token=29c691a7-5cb5-44ae-afd2-2c651a9c827b)

The editor will show the text *App text ([name])* and the app will show the string you have saved in the app text editor in the currently active language.

![app-text-example@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F0mPh7TJ4ssXoTys51zoi%2Fapp-text-example%402x.png?alt=media&token=49b9690c-edff-46f1-ab43-9a94f53054a8)

Application texts can be used in any dynamic expression. In the screenshot above we're using an app text called *My input* as the placeholder for a text input element.

This also means you can use them in workflows, element conditions and any other place where you can insert a dynamic expression. In the example above, we have selected *App text* as the data source, and *My input* as the operator: this is the ID of the particular string we want to show, which means it needs to be created first.

Editing application texts

To access the application text editor, go to *Settings - Languages.* Under *General settings* you will find your app's default language and the field on the user that determines the user's language preference (more on that below).

Under *Application texts and messages* you will find all the custom text strings that you have added (if any) as well as Bubble's core texts.

The left column is the ID of the text. In the example from earlier, the ID of the text was *My input*. We'll find this ID and

![app-text-string@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FMuyXac9pg3DSFEEIP7lK%2Fapp-text-string%402x.png?alt=media&token=ddaa2443-6e40-4b9a-a2e9-31de6ca9b36f)

The strings ID is on the left side, and the string that will be displayed to your users is on the right. Click the image to enlarge.

Core texts

The core texts are the text strings that Bubble includes by default. You can change their string, but they can't be deleted and their ID remains static. These strings cover different error/informational messages connected to Bubble's core functionality. These built-in texts are already translated into all the available languages.

Element strings

Some elements and plugins also add text strings that become available at the bottom of the list. For example, the multi-file uploader plugin adds standard texts such as *Cancel upload* and *Remove file*.

Exporting and importing translations

Bubble also lets you export all the language strings to a CSV file and then re-import the file after having made the needed adjustments to it. This way you can efficiently invite other users to translate the strings without giving them access to the Bubble editor.

- Click the *Export* button and download the CSV file that Bubble generates
- Make the needed adjustments to the file, but make sure that no text ID's are changed and that the columns remain exactly as they were when you downloaded the file
- Click the *Import* button and select the finished file.

Importing a CSV file will overwrite all strings, even if the cell in the CSV file is left empty. If you want to keep a string as it was upon export, make sure it remains in the file.

How Bubble determines the language

Bubble determines the app's current language based on the following hierarchy:

- The "lang" parameter in the URL if it is set
- The current user's language if the field exists and is it's value is valid
- The application primary language
- English

Adding multiple languages

Application texts are set up for multiple languages, and uses the IETF language tag language codes to identify each language and dialect.

Setting the main language

The main language is the language that is used by Bubble to run your app when no language setting is set. This language will be used to define the messages that your application can send and show to users and change how location-sensitive elements behave.

For instance, it will impact how dates are formatted in the Date Input element and the Calendar element or the map element's captions.

Setting the language field on the User

Users in Bubble don't have a language setting field built in, but lets you set one up if you need it. The name of the field is not important, but the field must return a valid IETF language tag to work – in other words, the field must contain a text that matches one of the abbreviations in the dropdown.

![language-list@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FBBl4wR4Qjj9f8L5x3A38%2Flanguage-list%402x.png?alt=media&token=a583927e-87f1-460c-bbbe-1ae0d2a5c223)

The language field on the user must return one of language codes in the language dropdown, such as fr_fr.

When you have set up the field, you assign that field to control the user's language setting with the dropdown *Language field on the user type*. Select the field you set up, and Bubble will automatically respond to the value in the field to display strings in the user's language.

​

![user-language-setting-bubble@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FypzWkMY20AuKwdrKbnWm%2Fuser-language-setting-bubble%402x.png?alt=media&token=d2937496-27c8-4da6-9136-427c627ed779)

In this example we have created a field called *Language* of type *text.* This particular user has the code ar_ar, which means they have selected Arabic as their language.

If the field is empty, Bubble will default to the language set in the *Application primary language* dropdown.

Setting the language with a URL parameter

The application language can also be set in the URL, by using the lang query string parameter. This means adding `lang=code` to the URL, where `code` is the standardized language code, i.e. the one found in Settings > Language (most, but not all, of these codes have the format of two characters, underscore, two characters).

For instance, using Russian in your app would be done by hitting this URL `https://myapp.com?lang=ru_ru`.

FAQ: Application text

If a text string is not translated into the active language, what will Bubble display?

If the user has selected a language and a string on the page has not been translated into that language, the text *(no translation)* will be displayed instead. Bubble's error console in the bottom right corner of the debugger will also flag a warning when you preview the page.

What happens if the language field on the user is empty?

If you have set a field on the user to be a language field and that field is empty or returns an invalid language code, Bubble will default to the language set in the *Application primary language* dropdown.

How do application strings affect performance?

The application strings you add become part of your applications JavaScript source code files. This means that they are downloaded to every user that opens up any of your pages.

For performance reasons, Bubble only downloads the text in the language that the user has selected – this is why changing the language on the user requires a page load so that the updated JavaScript file can be generated and downloaded.

Application strings are no more performance-taxing than placing the string directly on the element; if they are used in multiple places they are more lightweight, since they only need to be stored once. Even if you don't plan to translate your app it can be useful to maintain all your strings in one place.

Do Application texts support right-to-left writing (RTL)?

Yes, Application texts support RTL languages such as Arabic, Hebrew and Urdu. Note that you may need to tweak your app design if you plan to switch between LTR and RTL languages, so we recommend testing your application in both languages.

**Known Issue: right-to-left (RTL)**

When displaying text in a right-to-left (RTL) format and applying certain operations or changes, the text might switch back to a left-to-right display.

If you're prioritizing RTL support, we recommend previewing your pages in run-mode to ensure they display correctly.

I have made changes to app texts, why are the changes not visible in the live app?

If you can't see the changes you've made, please check the following:

- Changes in app texts are visible as follows:
   - Development: after the page is refreshed
   - Live: after the app has been deployed and page has been refreshed
- Check that you are viewing the app in the same language as the string you have changed
- Check that the *Saving* indicator next to the edit menu is showing *Saved* to confirm that the change has been synced to the Bubble server. If not, please check your internet connection.

 Option sets

This section covers option sets, used to store a static list of options in a database-like structure

Option sets let you set up different types of static options in a database-like structure, but without using the database. This is useful to store information like days of the week, marital status, colors, states, countries and other data that you want to load quickly and that's rarely updated.

![dropdown-option-set.gif](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F40r40My9jITeh2cusn4T%2Fdropdown-option-set.gif?alt=media&token=5ac145c8-b5ec-4bb0-abae-f571d89408a8)

Option sets can be used to store static options and use them around your app. In this example we have saved a list of colors as options in a set

Option sets become a part of your application's source code meaning that they are downloaded as part of the JavaScript file that makes up your application. As such, they don't require a database lookup and are cached on the user's device until you deploy a new version of your app, making them fast-loading and lightweight.

This also means that option sets cannot be added, edited or deleted by your users and require you to re-deploy your application before options become available in Live.

Option sets, unlike the database, are not encrypted and become a part of your application's source code. **Option sets should never contain any sensitive information.**

How option sets are structured

An option set, as the name suggest, is a set containing *options*. To each set you can add a list of *attributes* that are similar to the fields on a data type. Attributes can be set to be one of the following types:

- text
- number
- date
- date interval
- yes / no
- file
- image
- geographic address
- [other Option sets]

To summarize, each option set consists of a collection of options that share the same attributes of one of the types above.

Just like data types, option sets can be linked. For example, you could set up two option sets called *State* and *City* and create an attribute on the *City* that links to the State option set.

![option-set-example@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FJViLzOqmHc6XqB3rQM5y%2Foption-set-example%402x.png?alt=media&token=9954254a-556f-4f49-9685-2bc63d5eeee5)

In the example above, you see the option sets on the left-hand side (1) and the attributes on that option set on the right-hand side (2). The *Display* attribute is a built-in text field that identifies each option in the set.

Bubble doesn't require the value in the *Display* attribute to be unique, but it can still be a good idea to make sure that they are in case you need to filter the options by their Display value later. If you have duplicate values you may not get the results you want.

Creating option sets

To create a new option set, first access the option set tab by going to *Data - Option sets.* The list on the left-hand side will be empty and showing only the *New Option set* box. To create a new set, provide a name and click *Create*.

![create-option-set@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FhrmzI7ebmlo4WIQhayEM%2Fcreate-option-set%402x.png?alt=media&token=92905519-e1a3-4cca-80ca-5c7a64bf8e81)

In the *New option set* field, type in a name and click *Create*.

After creating the new option set (such as *State*), you can set up attributes on that set: in many cases you can use the built-in *Display* attribute to store the main identifier of each option. In this case this would be the name of the state, such as Massachusetts. You can create as many attributes on it as you need. For example, you could add a second text attribute containing the state code (MA).

Adding options

After an option set has been created and you have added the attributes you need to it, you can start adding the options. In an option set like *City*, the options would be the different cities you want to list, such as *Boston* and *Washington.*

![add-option-to-set@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FKPRGIIOEpiHTiHmweF0X%2Fadd-option-to-set%402x.png?alt=media&token=243cbdc2-03b2-4e07-b5c9-03a061f7f523)

To create a new option, pick the option set you want to add it to, and type in a name in the *New option* field, then click Create. The name you provide will be stored in the *Display* field on that option.

Editing attributes

To edit the attributes on an option set, click the *Edit attributes* link next to the option set in the list. This is not visible until you have created at least one option. In the example above we can assign the City we have created to a *State –* see [below](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/static-data/option-setlinking-option-sets) on how to link the two_._

![modify-attributes-option-set@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FWk7uR7BTvBwdghL4CIlM%2Fmodify-attributes-option-set%402x.png?alt=media&token=39f17eaf-e25a-4f51-9193-871873128aca)

To modify the attributes of an option, click the *Modify attributes* link in the lists of options.

Linking option sets

You can link option sets just like data types, by setting up the attribute on one or both of them to reflect the other. If we create an option set called *City*, we can link that city to the State option set:

![link-option-sets@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FyOsBthnpc8rvviI2NzOa%2Flink-option-sets%402x.png?alt=media&token=2f570570-d1fa-4d1b-b34c-9935f272ca00)

In the example above, we are linking the two by:

- Clicking the *Create attribute* button on the *City* option set
- Picking the *State* option set from the list of available types

Just like with data types, the attribute can also be set to be a *list,* but this won't be necessary in the example with State and City.

When the two are linked you can use it to filter a list of option sets (such as showing all Cities in the State of Massachusetts) or to display information in a page element, such as a text element showing *Boston - Massachusetts.*

Using option sets

Unlike Data types, you don't *search* for option sets: they are all loaded on page load and you can reference them in elements and workflows as needed.

As a data source on an element

In the example below, we are using option sets to display a list of Cities in a dropdown element.

![use-option-set@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FuA8KBDbeTyHEaLQCVvqW%2Fuse-option-set%402x.png?alt=media&token=d7bb1647-4b11-4c90-9c02-f9d202640c31)

- We've set up a dropdown with the placeholder *Pick a city*
- In the choices style we pick *Dynamic choices,* which lets you define the data source​
- In *Type of choices* we select the option set *Cities*
- In the *Choices source* we define what list we want to display. Note the difference between data types and option sets: we don't search for the options, we simply pick the *All Cities* to instruct Bubble to load all of them. If you want to filter the results, you can apply the :*filtered* operator after the data source, such as *All Cities:filtered.* In that filter you place constraints such as filtering the Cities by their State attribute.
- In the *Option caption* setting we set which attribute to use as the option's caption in the dropdown. In our example we have saved the name of the City in the *Display* attribute. We could also extend it to show the City *and* State by expanding the expression:

![option-caption-example@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FZQKoYTmRnkb0A3i1n37w%2Foption-caption-example%402x.png?alt=media&token=576ec604-68e5-4ddb-9b72-e41f4c2e25a1)

The example above would make each City be displaye with their State in the dropdown, such as *Boston - Massachusetts.*

In an expression

You can also use an option set as a data source in an expression and then filter or manipulate the result using operators.

![CleanShot 2023-03-08 at 13.58.16@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FGSdQonpxHnmM6xqaJOv9%2FCleanShot%202023-03-08%20at%2013.58.16%402x.png?alt=media&token=37dea030-95b2-48a6-87c2-dc46b185cd39)

In the screenshot above we are setting up a conditional expression on the dropdown element. To reference an option set, you can:

- Select it from the list of options that appear at the top of the dropdown. Bubble knows that the Option set is *City* since we are referring to the *value* of the dropdown (which is set to be a City)
- You can use the *Get an option* data source to access all option sets and use operators to find the right value

Option set FAQ

| ... can be referenced directly in an expression (such as referencing the *Boston* option without having to search for it) | ... can only be referenced by way of a search or a field on another data type              |

To summarize, Option sets are insecure, static values that can only be changed by the app developer and data types are secure, dynamic values that can be changed by any user with access.

I have made changes to an option set. Why can't I see the changes in the live app?

If you can't see the changes you've made, please check the following:

- Changes in option sets are visible as follows:
   - Development: after the page is refreshed
   - Live: after the app has been deployed and page has been refreshed
- Check that the *Saving* indicator next to the edit menu is showing *Saved* to confirm that the change has been synced to the Bubble server. If not, please check your internet connection.

Does Bubble only download the option sets that are used on a page

All option sets are downloaded on all pages (or the cached file is used if the file has already been downloaded to the User's device). This means two things:

- To avoid having to download a lot of data, you shouldn't let your collection of Option sets grow too big
- You should never store *any* sensitive information in an Option set, even if it's not in use on the page, as it's still part of your app's source code file

How do I search for option sets?

You don't search for option sets in the same way as data types, since they are already downloaded the user's device and not part of the database. You can list and filter option set options or reference one option directly without having to search for it.

You can read more about that [here](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/static-data/option-setusing-option-sets).

 Temporary data

This section covers temporary data, which is different types of variables that you can use to store data temporarily.

Sometimes you'll need to store some information temporarily in your application. They can be considered *variables* and are not in any permanent storage like the database, but live for as long as they are needed.

Bubble offers two different types of temporary data that have different properties:

Custom states

Custom states are a sort of variable that you can store on any element on your page, including the page itself. A custom state can be set up to contain any kind of elementary data (such as text, numbers and dates), [static data](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/static-data) like an [Option set](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/static-data/option-sets) or [dynamic data from your database](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database). You set the type of data the custom state should hold, and whether it should holda single valua or a list of values. You can then populate the custom state with data using workflows (or in some cases set a default value). You can create as many custom states as you need.

Custom states are reset when the page is reloaded.

[Custom states](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/temporary-data/custom-states)

​

URL parameters

URL parameters are strings of text that you can add to the URL of your application to store information. You can specify the type of data they are holding, and the data will be a visible part of the page's url. URL parameters are structured in key-value pairs and are separated from the main URL with a question mark (?). Additional parameters are separated with an ampersand (&).

[https://www.mydomain.com/page?parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2](https://www.mydomain.com/page?parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2)

In the example above , everything after the ? makes up the URL parameters. URL parameters are great for navigation, since they let your users use the browser's *back* button to go back one step.

[URL parameters](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/temporary-data/url-parameters)

The difference between Custom states and URL parameters

| ... can hold a list of values                                                           | ... one parameter can only hold a single value                                                                                            |
| ... can have a default value at page load (depending on the type of data)               | ... has to be set by a workflow from the same or another page, or be set by the user                                                      |
| ... cannot be changed by a user unless you set up workflows for it                      | ... can be edited by the user at will by making changes to the URL or using navigation gestures like clicking the browser's *back* button |

 Custom states

This section covers custom states, that are used to store temporary variables of different kinds

Custom states are variables that you can save on any element on the page, including the page itself. They let you store data temporarily that is reset when the page is reloaded. This is useful when you need your app to remember some information that you don't need to store permanently in the database.

While custom states are not visible to the users of your app directly, they are still not a secure way to store sensitive data. Keep in mind that any information you place in a custom state, including its default value, can be read by the user of that device.

Custom states have the following properties:

- They only hold data until the page is reloaded and its reset to its default value (empty by default)
- They are hidden from the user, but can be referenced in any dynamic expression where you need them
- They are stored client-side, and as such as faster than reading and writing to the database
- They can hold any kind of data, both elemental types (text, numbers, dates, etc), Option set options and custom data types. They can also hold lists of values
- Each custom state is connected to an element, and you can create as many as you need on each element, including the page itself

You can store *any* kind of Bubble data in a custom state, ranging from simple text values to a data type like a specific user, a shopping cart or anything else that you'd like your app to "remember".

Using lists of values, you can also set up custom states to keep track of multiple pieces of data. For example, you can keep track of when a user selects things in a repeating group by adding those things to the custom state's list.

Creating custom states

Any element can have a custom state attached to it, and it's up to you to decide which element is the most appropriate to store it on. You can create as many custom states as you need on each element.

There are two ways to define a custom state.

The *Set state of an element* action

You can create it when you use the *Set custom state* action:

![set-state-create-custom-state@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F89KWL5dgzFIAV4BYL1HU%2Fset-state-create-custom-state%402x.png?alt=media&token=4b5ad257-2426-4db0-9bc4-bf934d2ece2c)

- Add the *Set state of an element* action to a workflow
- Pick the element (the index page in the example) and then pick *Create a new custom state*.

If you have any existing custom states on that element, they will show up above the option to create a new one.

The element inspector

You can also create one or more new custom states by using the Element Inspector:

![element-inspector-opening.gif](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FkUEUEdfBAIFj1pfBjb87%2Felement-inspector-opening.gif?alt=media&token=a9f5a786-ec5b-45d3-b8fb-b24ce6d66211)

You can use the Element inspector both to create new custom states and to see the ones you've already created. In the example above we already have a custom state called *My state* of type text.

Click *Add a new custom state* in the right-hand window to create a new one.

Similarly to fields, a custom state needs to have a defined data type. This will enable the Bubble Editor to display the relevant options when using an element's state's value. You can set the data type to any of Bubble's built in data types, Option sets and custom data types.

![custom-state-types@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FoGwXSqnCGm8UMNg1K8nX%2Fcustom-state-types%402x.png?alt=media&token=f7ed0463-c06b-4787-83dc-dbf3b8caf50d)

Setting a data type instructs Bubble to treat the custom state in a way relevant for that type

Locating, editing and deleting a custom state

You can also use the Element Inspector to find, edit and delete existing custom states on an element. Click the information icon as shown in the animation above.

The name of a custom state is automatically updated all over your app and can safely be changed. You can also change the type of data in a custom state or delete it altogether, but both of these can generate errors in the issue tracker if it leads to workflows or expressions no longer working.

Assigning a value to a custom state

There are two different ways of assigning a value to a custom state:

- You can set its default value in the Element Inspector This only works for static values that you can type into the *Default value* field, such as text and numbers
- You can assign a value to a custom state using the *Set state of an element* action.

![set-state-action@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FGsU7sv5Q9Xrvq8RGJs2p%2Fset-state-action%402x.png?alt=media&token=a5910814-d302-4f79-8a56-f976cfe30d60)

You can use the *Set state of an element* action to assign a value to a state. In the example above the type of state is *text*

Any time you assign a value to a state, its last value is permanently overwritten.

Custom states are not automatically updated when database records are deleted. This means that if you are storing a list of things in a custom state, and one or more of those things are deleted from the database, the list will still show the same item count. The fields on the deleted data types will show up empty. You can get around this by applying a filter in any expression that counts the items in a list, such as *My element's custom state list:filtered [Creation Date is not empty]:count.*

 URL parameters

A URL parameter is a piece of information that you place in the browser's URL. They follow a key-value-pair structure and can hold many different types of data.

How URL parameters are structured

Every page in your application (except for the index page) has its own URL that follows a regular pattern:

[https://my-bubble-application.bubbleapps.io/mypage](https://my-bubble-application.bubbleapps.io/mypage)

or if you have connected to a domain:

[https://www.mydomain.com/mypage](https://www.mydomain.com/mypage)

This points the browser to the right domain and to the right page. The information in that URL is actually an instruction to the *server* to send the correct page back to the browser. In other words, your browser *sends* that URL to the server, which responds by sending back the files needed to display the page.

URL parameters also serve a function, but instead of talking to the *server* they can send messages to the current *page.* In other words, your Bubble app can write and read URL parameters in the browser's URL bar and use that information for different purposes.

URL parameters are listed after the complete page URL, and are separated from that URL with a question mark (?). If there are multiple parameters, they are separated from each other with an ampersand.

![url-parameter-structure.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FmCoqvhwIKiKAfXB8UFCm%2Furl-parameter-structure.jpeg?alt=media&token=6a3302d9-d167-4c86-8a80-5caf21b7554d)

Each URL parameter consists of a **key** and a **value**:

- The **key** identifies the parameter with a unique string of text such as *name*
- The **value** is the data that the parameter holds, such as *John*

The structure would then look like this:

name=John

If we place that in the full page URL (and separate it from the URL with a *?* as we explored earlier) we get:

[https://www.mydomain.com/mypage?name=John](https://www.mydomain.com/mypage?name=John)

Now to add slightly more complexity, let's change the *name* parameter to *firstname* and add a second parameter called *lastname*.

[https://www.mydomain.com/mypage?firstname=John&lastname=Doe](https://www.mydomain.com/mypage?firstname=John&lastname=Doe)

In this last example, Bubble would be able to identify the full name *John Doe* from the URL bar. Let's have a look at how that happens.

Reading URL parameters

**Note**: There are some **plugins** that can manipulate the browser's URL bar, including its parameters. It's worth noting that Bubble does not always catch updates to parameters if they are not made with the *Go to page* action. Recognizing the change may require a page reload or the plugin may be able to return an updated value.

As we've covered, the URL parameter consists of a key and a value, and we need to instruct Bubble what *key* to look for in order to get the value in return.

To do that, we set up an expression where we use the *Get data from page URL* data source.

![get-data-from-page-url@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F1YQjJGQ2drFuap1vwD9L%2Fget-data-from-page-url%402x.png?alt=media&token=c46f7168-2493-4ea3-8492-bf335c2f9588)

After picking the data source, Bubble will ask for some additional parameters:

![CleanShot 2023-03-08 at 20.58.09@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FYBreM9ou9CIxy97jvP7l%2FCleanShot%202023-03-08%20at%2020.58.09%402x.png?alt=media&token=48d1fc86-d2f8-43e9-9427-8c8da7aef79d)

- The first one is the **key** to identify our parameter. We want to fetch the first name (John), so we'll set that to *firstname*.
- Secondly, we need to tell Bubble what kind of data to expect. We can set this to *text.*

As soon as you set the key, you can see on the right side that Bubble updates the expression to say *Get firstname from page URL.*

If the parameter `name=John` exists in the URL, the text element will show the name John to our users. If the URL parameter can't be found or has an empty value, it will display nothing.

Reading different data types

In the example above we used the text data type to read a simple piece of information: a name. But URL parameters can also be used to read other types of data.

Bubble's general data types (text, numbers, dates, etc) need particular formatting in order to ensure compatibility with all browser.

Bubble automatically applies the correct formatting in most cases, but if you have hardcoded links or want to learn more about how the different data types are formatted, check out the info-box below.

Formatting Bubble's general data types in a URL parameter

Custom data type things

You can also link to a custom data type in a URL parameter. To read and retrieve the correct thing, that thing's Unique ID needs to be present in the parameter. The name (key) of the parameter does not affect the result, but when you use the *Get data from page URL* data source you need to set it to the correct data type, as exemplified below:

![get-thing-from-url.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FGDp5G1yAhfhHz9pJmsAF%2Fget-thing-from-url.png?alt=media&token=08cbcf7e-4c7b-4afc-b13b-be8ba00bddf3)

- First we set the name (key) that identifies the right parameter
- Then we set the *type* to the data type of the thing we want to retrieve
- Bubble then lets you add operators to the *Get data from page URL* data source relevant to that thing. In the example we are getting the name of the Task.

The URL in this case would look like this:

[https://www.mydomain.com/mypage?task=1676895495518x833172344879202800](https://www.mydomain.com/mypage?task=1676895495518x833172344879202800)

Option sets

You can also retrieve an option from an Option set. Option sets do not have Unique ID's but are identified by the value stored in the *Display* field. Just like with data types, you can give the parameter an arbitrary name, but you need to set the *type* to the Option set you want to retreive.

![get-option-set-from-url.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FGCI3wvm84yvQvSLmE1IJ%2Fget-option-set-from-url.png?alt=media&token=ee1a9f3e-0334-4567-a167-9c06696091f2)

- First we set the name (key) that identifies the right parameter
- Then we set the *type* to the Option set we want to retrieve
- Bubble then lets you add operators to the *Get data from page URL* data source relevant to that Option set. In the example we are getting the abbreviation of the State.

The URL in this case would look like this if we included the state name in the Display field:

[https://www.mydomain.com/mypage?state=Texas](https://www.mydomain.com/mypage?state=Texas)

Setting URL parameters

There are two ways to pass URL parameters to a page:

- The first is to **include it with the URL when the page loads**, for example by linking to the page with a URL that includes the parameters. Simply copy/pasting the URL into a link will have Bubble recognize the parameters on page load.
- The second is to use the ***Go to page*** **action** and checking *Send more parameters to the page.* This will apply the necessary encoding to whichever information you provide and send the parameter.

![go-to-page@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fd1L8UToNzGjTiupf8pu5%2Fgo-to-page%402x.png?alt=media&token=3aa8aff3-cf73-413a-9d41-d4aed2947c46)

The Go to page action lets you send the parameters by adding them in a list as illustrated above. The left-hand input field is the *key* and the right-hand field is the *value.* If you remain on the same page, the page will not be reloaded, but the parameters will be instantly updated.

The **Go to page** action does not reload the page if you are going to the same page that you are already viewing. This means you can set and change URL parameters as much as needed without the page having to be reloaded.

​

FAQ: URL Parameters

Can you pass a list of Things in a URL parameter?

You can only pass one value at a time in each URL parameter (but you can create as many parameters as you need, within the maximum URL length supported by the browser). There may be workarounds to pass lists, but it's not officially supported by Bubble at this point.

Are URL parameters secure?

URL parameters are not insecure by and of themselves, but they can require that you understand the potential vulnerabilities associated with using them. For example:

- They are fully editable by your users, meaning that they can add, remove and change URL parameters as they want.
- They are of course also fully visible in the browser's URL bar, meaning that they should never contain any sensitive data
- When used for navigation, keep in mind that a tech-savvy user can pay attention to the URL parameters and understand their structure: if you don't secure your navigation in other ways the user may be able to access sections they are not supposed to
- When including custom data types in the URL, you are revealing the Unique ID of that thing. Again this is not a vulnerability on its own, but can *lead* to vulnerabilities. Someone could for example replace the Unique ID in the URL to see a record that's not their own: the things needs to be protected with Privacy Rules

 User accounts

This article covers how you create and manage Users in your app

![profile-pic.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FjaZFND9sQ0zm6noa1B9r%2Fprofile-pic.png?alt=media&token=f4e6ffbc-da87-46fb-831d-cbcc3b1323ba)

In this article, we're going to explore how Bubble's handles the process of setting up and managing user accounts.

Technically, users are just another data type stored in your app's database, but there are several reasons why Bubble treats the user type a bit differently:

- The built-in user authentication system provides robust security features to safeguard user data, such as password hashing, salting and encryption
- Processes like signing up, logging in and remembering a user between sessions are automated
- Features such as confirming email addresses, securely resetting passwords, 2-factor authentication, magic login links and generating/assigning temporary passwords are all securely handled
- Bubble sets up temporary users whenever non-logged in users visit your site. Data stored on that user is automatically transferred when the user completes their sign-up (this is useful to store a a new users shopping cart for example)
- Privacy Rules treat users differently than other data types, allowing you to control access to data based on fields stored on each individual user. This lets you manage user permissions and control access to sensitive data in a granular way

In short, managing user accounts demands strict security to ensure the protection of users' sensitive information, and the functionality of user accounts remains fairly uniform across different platforms. This is why Bubble takes care of this aspect of your application's development, saving you development time while ensuring that your app is up-to-date with the latest security standards.

What is a user account?

Most of us have dozens or even hundreds of user accounts in our lives: we're logged into our phones, our email accounts, social media, forums and even newspapers. Of course, we all know what they are, so let's change perspective a bit: *why* does an app need user accounts?

The first answer to that question is that not all apps do: it's perfectly possible to create a highly useful app where the user never creates an account at all, even if you allow users to add and change things in the database. So let's first note that down: your app can have, *users* or *registered users* or both. This article focuses on *registered users* – that is, users that have signed up with their email and a password or a through a single sign-on service.

Registering users serves many purposes:

- **Keeping data private:** in many contexts a user should only have access to the data they themselves own or that of a select group of other users
- **Saving settings:** many apps allow users to save preferences and profile details that are still there the next time they use the app
- **Controlling Access**: many apps allow *only* registered users to access its pages
- **Assigning roles and permissions**: having registered users allows you to identify each one and assign them roles that control what they have permission to access
- **Personalization:** some applications, such as social media and eCommerce stores, offer a stream of personalized content for each user
- **Teaming up**: some apps will need to team people together so that they can share data and collaborate. To control who has access to what you'll need to know who they are
- **Payment processing**: to process payments and maintain an order and payment history you will usually want to attach it to a permanent user
- **Communication**: by knowing who your users are, you can communicate with them through the app or external channels like email

As you can see, there are many reasons for why you would want a user to sign up, and it's not only related to security and privacy. Just like any other data type, you can add as many different fields as you need, but the user type also comes with a few extra fields to handle the account.

These fields can't be changed or deleted and are the same across all Bubble applications.

Built-in fields

In addition to the four built-in fields on all data types, the user also comes with three additional fields:

- Email
- Password (invisible)
- Email confirmed (invisible)

These fields have the following properties:

Email

The email field can never be empty on a registered user and needs to be formatted as a valid email address. Every user in your app needs to have a unique email address.

Password (invisible)

The password field is different from all other fields in that it is invisible even to you as the app developer. The password is kept secure in accordance with industry-standard practices.

How passwords are kept safe

Email confirmed (invisible)

The email confirmed is another invisible field. It holds a yes/no value that reflects whether the relevant user has confirmed their email using the [*Send confirmation email*](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/accounsend-confirmation-email) action. You cannot make changes to this field directly – the user must perform the action described above to update it.

![user-email-confirmed@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Ffg6fyFWF0mBpNrU2Pmks%2Fuser-email-confirmed%402x.png?alt=media&token=543d267b-a292-43b8-948f-38a91c498cb6)

The email confirmed field is invisible in the database editor but you can access its value in an expression as exemplified above.

User actions

This article explores common actions related to user accounts, but doesn't provide details on every available user action. To learn more about what actions and operators are available on users, you can check out the resources below: Reference: [List of user account actions](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/account) Reference: [List of user operators](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/operations-and-comparisonuser-type)​

Signing up

While the technical process of signing up is handled by Bubble, the design and user experience is entirely up to you.

![signup.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FyojQBL32U84cYC52PydJ%2Fsignup.jpg?alt=media&token=65e913c8-4bea-4997-9078-8fa79f6e52f0)

Bubble handles the security and the communication with the database, but the user experience is up to you.

The sign up action

When you want to sign a user up, you need that user to provide two strings of text: a valid email address that's unique in your app and a password.

![sign-up-user@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FOIQe7xZPSuC13F01q29u%2Fsign-up-user%402x.png?alt=media&token=ec3b7067-9812-45f9-8809-06e9ddff32fe)

In this example we are signing the user up and then sending them to a page called *dashboard*.

The email and password will usually be provided through input elements. In the example above we have *two* input elements where the new user types in their password: one to set the password and the second to confirm that they didn't misspell it.

Users in your app must have a unique email address.

The information is sent to Bubble's server in an encrypted state, and the password is hashed and salted – a security best practice that means that *no one* can read it – not even the Bubble team.

Keep in mind that input elements can be set up to format their input in a certain way (such as replacing the characters in a password input field with asterisks) and to expect a certain format (such as a valid email address). We recommend using both of these features when setting up both signup and login forms. Article section: [Input elements](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/input-forms/text-and-numbertext)​

As soon as this action has been triggered the account will be created and the user is logged in from that point on. A logged-in session lasts for 12 months or until the user logs out or deletes the cookies from their browser.

Logging in

The log in action is very similar to the sign up action in that it requires two pieces of input: the email and the password. Bubble then sends this data in an encrypted state to the server to check the credentials. If they are both correct the user is logged in.

Signing up and logging in with an SSA provider

An SSA provider is a third-party service that you can use to let users log in. For example,

OAuth - signing up and logging in with a third-party service

The most common way to authenticate users is to prompt them to enter a password or an email. However, sometimes, you will be using some external such as Facebook, LinkedIn or Gmail to authenticate users using their credentials from that service.

This has a few advantages to consider:

- It lets users authenticate faster, and they don't need to remember another password. The signup process is usually done with a few quick clicks (depending on the external service and whether the user is already logged in)
- This will sometimes let you fetch some data on behalf of the users, such as their email, profile pictures and social media posts

We'll use Facebook as an example below (in other words, your app offers a button 'Login with Facebook'.).

Signing up with Facebook

The guide below describes how Facebook login works overall. To read more about the different settings on the Facebook login plugin, check out the resources below. Article: [Using the Facebook Graph API plugin](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/user-accounts/authentication-plugins/facebook-plugin)​

Reference: [Facebook](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/bubble-made-plugins/facebook)​

When you set up such a flow in Bubble, you will need to define the level of authorization you want from your users for your app to function. By default, most services only expose the public profile and the email when users sign up on a third party application using their credentials, but you can ask for more permissions (for instance, post on their wall).

It's best practice both from a user and security perspective to only ask for permissions if you need them, and it's worth keeping in mind that asking for a long list of permissions can lead to fewer users signing up.

When a user signs up with a social network (Facebook) in Bubble, a new user is created in the database, similarly to a traditional sign up flow with email and password.

The main difference is that the way to login for the user, once logged out, will not be by entering their password (since they didn't define one), but by logging in with Facebook. If a user is logged in with Facebook and your app uses Facebook login in the same browser, the user is automatically logged in as that Facebook user.

Mixing traditional and social logins

Users in Bubble can use traditional logins and social logins at the same time. There are a few different scenarios in which this could play out. We cover this in the the dedicated OAuth article below:

Article series: [OAuth plugins](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/user-accounts/authentication-plugins)​

Temporary users

The moment you sign a user up is when you assign them an email address and permanent storage in the database. In many cases (but not always) this is also when a user provides a password to use to access the account later.

From a data perspective, Bubble actually keeps track of who the user is at an earlier point (with one exception): whenever a new user visits your application, Bubble saves a cookie in their browser and creates a temporary user.

This Bubble feature means that as long as your app allows for cookies, the *current user* data source will never return an empty value. If you want to check whether a user is actually signed in, you can use the *current user* *is logged in* operator.

This allows you to "remember" who the user is during the session, and lets you set up application logic that rely on accessing data stored on the current user.

This is useful in different scenarios:

- Saving preferences and settings
- Storing temporary data like a shopping cart
- Personalizing the user experience

When the sign-up process is completed, Bubble transfers the temporary data over to the newly created user automatically.

Data stored on a temporary user is transferred automatically when the user signs up, but not when they log in.

User account FAQ

How can I help my users log in if I can't see their password?

It's widely regarded as a basic security best practice that no one, not even the developer of an app, should have access to a user's password. The best way to help a user log in if they have lost their password is to help them [reset the password](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/accounreset-password) or to [generate a temporary one](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/accounassign-a-temp-password-to-a-user).

Can I log users out from sessions across multiple devices?

Yes, you can use the [Log out other user's sessions](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/accounlog-out-other-users-sessions) action for that. Note that this action logs the user out from all devices *except* the one they are running the action from. If you want that session to log out as well you'll need to use the [Log the user out](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/accounlog-the-user-out) action.

How long does the user stay logged in?

It depends on the settings you set in the [*Log the user in*](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/accounlog-the-user-in) action:

- ​[Temporary users](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/user-accounttemporary-users) (those who haven't signed up but have a cookie) will remain active on the same device for **72 hours**
- If the *Keep the user logged in* checkbox is unchecked, the user will be logged out after **24 hours**
- If the box is checked, the user will be logged out after **12 months**

There are other instances where the user will be logged out:

- If the [Log the user out](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/accounlog-the-user-out) action is triggered
- If the [Log out other user's sessions](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/accounlog-out-other-users-sessions) is triggered on another device
- If the user clears their browser's cookies

Is there a difference between using the *Make changes to* action and setting the data source to *current user* and using the *Make changes to current user* action?

No, there's no difference between the two: they will both let you change any custom field on the user.

Why can't I select the user's email field in a Make changes to the current user action?

The password field is special in that it's considered a part of the user's *credentials*. That's why we have a dedicated action for updating it called [*Update the user's credentials*](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/accounupdate-the-users-credentials)*.* For security reasons, this action requires that the user re-enter their password (meaning that you need to set up an input element for it).

 Authentication plugins

OAuth plugins allow you log users in using a third-party authentication platform such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and others.

This article series covers how to set up the official plugins developed by Bubble or the third party offering the external service.

This article series covers the Bubble-made/provider-made OAuth plugins. There may be other plugins available in the plugin stores the offer different features on the same OAuth providers, or additional OAuth providers. For documentation and the latest updates on these plugins, please reach out to the plugin creators.

Throughout this article, we will refer to *you* as the Bubble developer as the *user*, and the users of your app as *end-users*.

Auth: The basics

Imagine you're at a party and someone you trust (like a friend) vouches for someone new, saying they're cool. You're more likely to trust this new person because your friend says they're okay. That's kind of like what OAuth does, but in the digital world.

**What is OAuth?**

OAuth stands for "Open Authorization", and is a standard for delegating access to apps and systems. In simpler terms, it lets an end-user give an app permission to access their information on another app without giving away the password to that app.

In this context, it means that the user can use that third-party platform to sign up and log in to your Bubble app. It sometimes means that your app can fetch information about that end-user, such as their email, name, social media posts and profile picture too, removing the need for a manual form. In some cases, the user can choose what information to reveal.

**How does OAuth work?**

- **Requesting Permission**: When an end-user uses your app, and needs to access information from another service (like Google, Facebook, etc.), the web app will redirect the end-user to a form hosted by that app/system, and ask for permission. This is like asking, "Hey, can I check your info on Google?"
- **Approval and Tokens**: If the end-user says "Yes," Google (in this case) gives your app a special code, called an *access* *token*. Think of this token like a temporary VIP pass; it lets the web app access only what the end-user agreed to share and nothing more.
- **Access and Security**: The web app uses this token to get the information it needs. Your app never knows the end-user's password for Google, giving the user a secure way to sign up/log in.

Why is OAuth useful?

- **Security**: It keeps passwords safe. The end-users password with the OAuth provider is never revealed to your Bubble app.
- **Control**: End-users can control what information they share and can revoke access at any time.
- **Convenience**: It's easier for end-users. They don’t need to create new accounts for every web app they use.

How does OAuth look to the end-user?

Most of your end-users are not aware of what OAuth is and how it works, and in most cases, they don't have it, as long as it provides an easy-to-use and secure way to sign up and log in.

Here's how the process typically unfolds:

- **Choosing to connect**: The end-user arrives at your app and sees an option to log in or sign up using services like Google or Facebook.
- **Clicking to proceed**: They select this option, often presented as a button labeled "Sign in with Google" or similar.
- **Reviewing permissions**: A pop-up window appears, asking the end-user to confirm if they are comfortable sharing certain information with your app, such as their email address.
- **Consenting to share**: If the end-user agrees, they click "Allow" or a similar confirmation button.
- **Access granted**: Your app now accesses the necessary information, and the end-user is directed to their account, ready to use your app's features.
- **Managing access**: The end-user can always manage what information they've shared with various apps, including yours, through their account settings on the service they used to log in.

Actions, elements and data sources

Actions

Signing up/logging in using a third-party OAuth app can add new actions to your app, relevant to the app the end-user is using to authenticate. For example, the Slack plugin allows you to post bot messages in a given Slack channel.

Data sources

Some OAuth providers provide new data sources that can provide basic or extensive data about the end-user on that platform, such as:

- The end-user's full name and/or nickname
- Profile picture
- Social media posts

Elements

Some plugins also add new elements to the Bubble editor. For example, the Facebook plugin offers an element to show a number of likes for a given Facebook page.

External documentation

Throughout this article series, we often point to external documentation. This approach is taken to guarantee that the information provided is both current and accurate. For instance, the method for generating and retrieving an API token or key can vary based on the specific service you're linking to. In these cases, the documentation from the respective third-party service is the definitive and up-to-date source for such procedures.

Please note that Bubble is not responsible for the content found in these third-party links.

​

FAQ: Third-party authentication plugins

Is OAuth secure?

Yes, OAuth is considered highly secure, equal to using a username and password. All communication with the third-party is encrypted and routed through Bubble's server.

Can I offer more than one authentication service?

Yes, you can offer as many as you like, but the end-user's selected choice is permanent. If the end-user wants to connect to a different provider after signing up, they will need to create a new account.

Can I combine an OAuth account with a traditional email/password account?

Users in Bubble can use traditional logins and social logins at the same time. There are a few cases here:

- **Signing up when logged in:** When a user already logged in with their email and password chooses to link their account with an OAuth provider, their existing account gets updated with the new authentication credentials. This means no new user account is created. After completing this linking process, the user has the flexibility to log in either with their email and password or through the OAuth flow.
- **Email already exists:** However, if a user tries to sign up by linking an account with OAuth and another user in the database already has the same email as the one provided by the external service, the process won't succeed. Instead, the user will receive a notification about the issue.
- **Signing up without being logged in (existing account):** On the other hand, if a user isn't logged in and goes through the OAuth flow, the system will create a new user account. But, if there's an existing user in the app's database with the same email as the one registered with the external service (like Facebook), this action will also fail, and the user will be informed.
- **Adding password to existing OAuth account:** For users who initially signed up using an external service and want to add a password to their account, they can do so by initiating a 'reset the user's password' action. This step adds email and password credentials to their account, which previously only used OAuth for authentication.

Facebook is a widely-used social media platform that allows users to connect with friends and family, share photos and videos, join groups, and participate in various social activities online. It's known for its vast user base and influential role in digital communication and media sharing.

The Facebook plugin allows your end-users to sign up/log in to their app using their Facebook account, as well as showing a *Likes* and *Pages* element relevant to their account in your app. You can also enable a broader access that includes the end-user's list of friends.

Keys

External documentation

The Facebook Graph API follows a common pattern of requiring two different keys to authenticate your app.

- **App ID/API key (client token):** The App ID (also referred to as the API Key in some contexts) is essentially the public identifier for your app. Think of it like the name tag your app wears when it talks to Facebook. In this context, it's not to be confused with your secret access token: In fact, the App ID doesn't need to be kept secret.
- **App secret (access token):** The Secret Key, on the other hand, is like a password. It's used to secure communication between your app and Facebook's servers. Exposure of the Secret Key can lead to security risks, unlike the App ID.

Scope

We offer two different scopes for the Facebook Graph API, that have the following properties:

Simple

The *Simple* option grants access to basic information such as the user's name, email, and profile picture. This option requires less permissions to be enabled when the end-user authenticates for the first time.

With friends

The *With friends* option extends this access to include the user's list of friends. Choosing this permission requires broader permissions from the end-user when they authenticate for the first time.

Development keys and Live keys

Facebook offers the convenient option of having separate keys for the development and live versions of your app. This feature is highly recommended as it allows you to thoroughly test your application during development without impacting the live connection.

Using separate keys ensures that any changes or tests you perform in the development stage won't affect your end-users who are interacting with the live version of your app. See Meta's [documentation](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/user-accounts/authentication-plugins/facebook-plugiexternal-documentation) for more information on setting up development keys.

FAQ: Facebook Graph API plugin

What should I do if I accidentally expose my App ID?

The App ID is a public identifier, and does not need to be replaced if it's exposed.

What should I do if I accidentally expose my secret key?

The secret key should be kept securely private, as exposure can lead to security risks. We strongly recommend revoking the exposed key and creating a new one immediately. Remember to deploy the changes in your app to Live after replacing the secret key.

 Fitbit plugin

What is Fitbit?

Fitbit is a health and fitness brand known primarily for its wearable devices that track physical activity, sleep patterns, and other personal metrics. These devices, alongside their apps, help users monitor and improve their health and fitness goals. Fitness is owned by Google's parent company Alphabet Inc.

The plugin allows your end-users to log in with their Fitbit accounts, fetch their workout data, and update their subscription status through the web API.

![fitbit-oauth-bubble@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FgZbPwpzbiDrIM0Ywo08v%2Ffitbit-oauth-bubble%402x.png?alt=media&token=3041a135-2bc8-46d9-8883-66032d510951)

Setting up and configuring the Fitbit Web API

External documentation

The Fitbit API follows a common pattern of requiring two different keys to authenticate your app.

- **Client ID:** The Client ID (also referred to as the API Key in some contexts) is essentially the public identifier for your app. Think of it like the name tag your app wears when it talks to Fitbit. In this context, it's not to be confused with your secret access token: In fact, the Client ID doesn't need to be kept secret.
- **Client Secret (access token):** The Secret Key, on the other hand, is like a password. It's used to secure communication between your app and Fitbit's servers. Exposure of the Secret Key can lead to security risks, unlike the App ID.

After you've installed the Fitbit plugin, the first step is to set up a developer account to obtain an OAuth key. If you already have a Fitbit account, you can use that login. With your developer account in place, the next move is to register a new app on the Fitbit developer portal.

During the app registration process, you'll input various details about your app. Upon completion, Fitbit will provide you with a client ID and a secret key, which are essential for your OAuth 2.0 integration.

Next, you'll need to transfer both the client ID and the client secret into the corresponding fields in your plugin settings on [Bubble.io](http://Bubble.io).

Note that you can activate a generic redirect URL within the Bubble plugin settings.

Setting up the YouTube plugin

After installing the plugin, you'll find it in your list of installed plugins and can click it to access its settings:

Actions, elements and data sources

To see the plugin's actions and data sources, as well as their properties, please see the core reference article below:

FAQ: YouTube plugin

What should I do if I accidentally expose my Client ID?

The Client ID is a public identifier, and does not need to be replaced if it's exposed.

What should I do if I accidentally expose my secret key?

The secret key should be kept securely private, as exposure can lead to security risks. We strongly recommend revoking the exposed key and creating a new one immediately. Remember to deploy the changes in your app to Live after replacing the secret key.

 Cookies set by Bubble

By default, Bubble sets a couple of cookies on end-users and visitors of your Bubble app. These are for authentication purposes and enable key functionality of the Bubble platform, such as keeping an end-user logged in, being able to tie a visitor to an app user through sign-up, etc.

To be specific, here are the cookies Bubble sets by default:

- One to mark the user’s session ID
- One with the session signature to prevent tampering
- One that tells the browser who the current user is

In addition, you may see a cookie (__cfduid) from Cloudflare (a feature which is provided by Bubble for all apps), which is described [here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-Understanding-the-Cloudflare-Cookie12345682) but is being deprecated by Cloudflare [starting May 2021](https://blog.cloudflare.com/deprecating-cfduid-cookie/).

Note that there is a [setting](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/application-settings/generado-not-set-cookies-on-new-visitors-by-default) for your app that stops Bubble from setting cookies on new visitors; this is off by default.

Also, various plugins that you choose to install in your app may also set cookies on the app's visitors or end-users. If a plugin does this, Bubble has no way to offer finer-grained control over those cookies. If this is a concern to you, we recommend you try installing the plugin and seeing what cookies are set in run-mode to determine if it's appropriate for your use case.

 Logic

This section covers Logic - the expressions and workflows that makes your app do the things you want it to do

We've covered *Design –* making your app look like you want it to – and *Data –* How information is stored, edited and fetched from the datatabase. The *Logic* section covers how to make Bubble *do* stuff: by combining workflows and expressions, you can set Bubble up to perform tasks for your users ranging from very simple to highly complex.

Workflows

Building workflows is a combination of connecting an *event* (such as a user clicking a button) with one or more *actions* (that can write to the database, animate things on the page and a long list of other things.

Article series: [Workflows](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/workflows)​

Dynamic expressions

By using *dynamic expressions* you can set up logical "sentences" that calculate values, return a dynamic conditional yes/no, search for things in the database, call external API sources and lots more.

They are how you work with logical rules and calculations in Bubble.

Article: [Dynamic expressions](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/dynamic-expressions) Video: [How to build expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrh8OV79snk)​

Conditions

Conditions are used to set up rules for how elements, workflows and actions behave. For example, a condition can control that under certain circumstances, a button should change color or become invisible or unclickable (such as a button being unclickable if the user is not logged in). Likewise, an action or workflow can be set up to only run if a condition is true: again, you could for example stop a workflow from running if the user is not logged in.

Article: [Conditions](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/conditions)​

Navigation

Navigation can mean two things in Bubble; the first is to go to another page completely, either in your own app or through an external link. The second is to navigate within the same page, which is done by hiding and showing elements as the user clicks around your app without having to reload the page.

Article: [Navigation](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/navigation)​

----
 The frontend and backend

This section describes the difference between workflows running on the frontend and backend

The availability of backend features described in this article can vary depending on which plan you are on. You can see a comparison between the different plans on our [pricing page](https://bubble.io/pricing/compare).

Everything happening in your application is made possible by the continuous exchange of commands and data between the **user's device** (such as a computer or phone) and **Bubble's server.**

Many commands start on the user's device. For example, a user may click a *Submit* button to save something, and that command – along with the data associated with it – is sent to Bubble's server to be stored in the database.

At other times, the command may start on the server: for example, a user may have registered their account one week ago and after that week the server sends an email to the user to help with onboarding or ask them to finish a survey.

This article will explore the interactions happening between the server and will work as an introduction to the rest of the *Logic* section.

> Before diving into how Bubble's workflows, expressions, and other parts of the app logic work, it's important to understand how the user's device and Bubble's server work in tandem.

The frontend

The frontend refers to anything that happens on a Bubble page. This is where your users interact with your app and where your workflows and expressions make that happen.

**Frontend workflows** react to what the user does, things happening on the page and changes in the user's data. They sometimes finish their work without ever sending or requesting anything from the server, but a large part of their work is done by communicating different requests over the internet and getting a response from Bubble. What they all have in common is that they are built using the front-end editor.

**Elements** are all the different things you place on the page, such as text, images, input forms and lists. They can contain static data that doesn't require information from the Bubble database, but in many cases they display data that's requested from the server, such as a user's name, a list of tasks, a product's image or an aggregated summary of yesterday's sales.

> The front-end is like a temporary universe that exists only for as long as the user has the page open. No commands or exchanges of data happen when the page is closed.
The front-end is edited every time you make changes to a page.

The backend

The backend refers to events and workflows that run 100% on Bubble's server. They can trigger and run without user commands, and they don't rely on the user keeping their page open. They are used for a different set of purposes than the frontend, which relies mainly on what kind of action the user takes or what they are supposed to see on the screen.

For example, using the backend you can:

- Schedule a workflow to run at a specific date and time, such as:
   - Sending an email two days after the user signed up
   - Change something in the database (for example reverting the user to inactive after a 30-day trial period)
   - Processing a scheduled payment
- Run workflows as a response to changes happening in your database
- Run workflows at recurring times, such as once per week/month/year
- Accept and respond to API requests from external apps

The backend is edited in the section called *backend workflows.*

> Unlike front-end workflows, back-end workflows will trigger and run regardless of whether the user still has the page open.

Accessing the backend editor

To access the backend, you need to follow two steps:

Activating the backend editor

If this is the first time you are accessing the backend editor in the currently open app, you will need to activate it in your app's settings:

![activate-backend@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FKbA0AuVM3ZUS2v9ARwOy%2Factivate-backend%402x.png?alt=media&token=1190b020-a71d-4cff-95b2-369d5e279e41)

The backend editor is disabled by default, but can be activated in your settings.

- Navigate to the *Settings* tab
- Click on *API*
- Check the box with the label *Enable Workflow API and backend workflows*

----
 Workflows

This section covers workflows - the engine in your app that makes stuff happen.

Workflows are the engine of your application – they are how you instruct Bubble to respond to what the user does, such as clicking a button, with a set of actions that can do anything from hiding/showing or animating things on the page to making changes in the database and make external API calls.

A *workflow* is the combination of an *event* that triggers one or more *actions*.

![workflow-schema.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FixsfXqyGYp0EYeqkGX3u%2Fworkflow-schema.jpeg?alt=media&token=31eb1a55-017c-44c0-bcca-c09cf4608c44)

Events

An event is anything that tells a workflow to run, such as:

- A button being clicked
- An input's value being changed
- A condition being true
- A user logging in or out
- Changes in the database

Events can run on a page, or they can be triggered server-side (which doesn't require that a user has a page open).

Article series: [Events](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/workflows/events)​

Actions

Actions are the operations that take place when a workflow is triggered by an event. You can place as many actions as you need inside one workflow. Actions can do things like:

- Creating, updating and deleting things in your database
- Hiding, showing and animating elements on the page
- Creating user accounts and logging users in/out
- Sending emails
- Navigating to a different page
- Loading data
- Using plugins, such as making a payment

This is not an exhaustive list, but as you can see, the actions in a workflow is how you make your app respond to a user's actions or changes in conditions.

Article: [Actions](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/workflows/actions)​

Organizing workflows

Workflows in the workflow editor can be categorized in two ways for easier navigation: by creating folders and adding colors to workflows. There are no rules or best practices on how to best organize your workflows, but we recommend giving some thought as to how you can combine colors with folders to efficiently navigate pages with a lot of workflows.

Colors

Each workflow you add can be given one of the following colors:

- Gray (default)
- Blue
- Red
- Green
- Orange
- Purple
- Cyan
- Brown

![set-workflow-color.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fczvj918NUTJqxHMpO3jh%2Fset-workflow-color.png?alt=media&token=8df73d60-f99a-4dce-afb3-35895e81e268)

Workflow colors are set on the settings of the workflow in the *Event color* dropdown.

Folders

You can also organize workflows into folders, available by expanding the workflow folder navigator on the left-hand side of the workflow editor. There are no folders by default, but you can create as many as you need. Workflows can belong to one folder, and workflows that are in no folders will be visible in the *All workflows* view or *No folder assigned* view.

![workflow-filders.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FXOcn2JhjV42B7xOaTyT0%2Fworkflow-filders.png?alt=media&token=883ff73d-1be7-4cc3-98bf-389b5a2238cc)

In the example above we have created a folder called *Page load* where we can place anything related to the page loading. Also notice the *Workflow tree* underneath the *Workflow folders,* which will reflect whichever folder you have open to leat you navigate workflows on complex pages.

Errors in workflows

Workflows can hit errors in different scenarios. For example:

- A user tries to log in using the wrong credentials
- A user tries to sign up using an email that already exists in the database
- A credit card payment fails because the card is declined

If a workflow runs into an error, it will stop running on the action where the error happened. Any previous actions will not be reverted.

Note that the errors we are discussing in this section are related to system errors, and not to errors that are flagged by Bubble's issue tracker.

Handling errors

Bubble's default way to communicate most errors is to show the error in the browser's standard message popup. You can instruct Bubble to handle errors on specific elements or more broadly on a page by using two different events. The links below point to guides for each type:

An element has an error running a workflow

This event will catch errors that happen related to a specific element. For example, if a *Log in* button connected to a workflow containing the *Log the user in* action generates an error, the error will be connect to that button.

Article section: [Using the *An element has an error running a workflow* event](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/workflows/events/frontend-eventexample-catching-errors)​

An unhandled error occurs

This event will catch errors more broadly: any error on the page will trigger it unless it's caught by another error event.

Video tutorial: [How to use the Unhandled Error Occurs event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC2_8yiTD44)​

Workflow timeouts

In rare cases, a workflow can time out. Currently, if a workflow has been running without being able to finish within 5 minutes, it will be stopped. Any actions that did finish before that will not be reverted.

Workflow timeouts will mostly only happen on workflows that are unusually complex or that try to process a very large volume of data. For example, actions like *Make changes to a list of things* is good for shorter lists, but can time out if you include too many entries. We do not recommend using any actions that involve making changes to a list of things on more than 100 things.

If you need to process a longer list of items, you may check out the more advanced, but also more performance-friendly recursive workflows.

Running too many workflows at once

Running too many workflows at once can also make some or all of them time out because you run out of available capacity. It's important to keep in mind that as your app scales with more users, the number of workflows being triggered will expand along with it. Be careful adding workflows to page load that make changes in the database for example; if a lot of users load the page at the same time, this can overload the system.

To mitigate this, consider spacing out workflows to the extent possible, or check your options for getting more capacity.

----
 Events

This section covers events, which are the triggers that start a workflow

Events can happen both in the **frontend** and **backend** parts of your app. If you are unfamiliar with this concept we recommend you first read our dedicated article on the subject: Article: [The frontend and backend](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/the-frontend-and-backend)​

All workflows are a collection of one or more actions that are triggered by an **event**. In other words, the event is the starting point that initiates the running of one or more actions in a workflow.

![events.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FhHx9ynlgYcvZhkQbuRoI%2Fevents.jpeg?alt=media&token=9f1cced8-f0ef-4442-bb11-9ce75ee589fe)

As the diagram above illustrates, every workflow consists of these two steps, but how these steps work is highly flexible. This article will focus on the various conditions that can result in an event being triggered.

![event@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F3b8BxigUzXMiNWhYsjUl%2Fevent%402x.png?alt=media&token=3b7fc592-f55d-40b8-a2ca-17101910872d)

In the Workflow editor, clicking an event shows and lets you add actions to run whenever the event is triggered.

Frontend and backend events

Frontend and backend events are different in one simple way: the former refers to events that are triggered on the user's device and the latter refers to events that are triggered on the server.

![server-vs-device-events.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FpQZtx1mSegmIhhLf7Huy%2Fserver-vs-device-events.jpeg?alt=media&token=0df8ec81-a51b-44d8-a441-6d6d402e436a)

The *event* refers to what *triggers* a workflow. A workflow triggered on the user's device (frontend) can still lead to stuff happening on the server – but it *starts* on the device.

​

Frontend events

Frontend events are the triggers that happen on a **page.** It's often – but not always – initiated by a user. Frontend events will only trigger as long as the page is open. They are categorized into three categories:

- **Element events** - all events related to elements, such as one being clicked.
- **General events** - general events are triggered as soon as a general property of the app change, such as when a user logs in/out or a conditional dynamic expression becomes true.
- **Custom events** - custom events are events that can be triggered by another workflow, to avoid duplicating workflows that you use in multiple places

Frontend events can still lead to *actions* happening on the server – but the *event* (or trigger) happens on the page.

Article series: [Frontend events](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/workflows/events/frontend-events)​

Backend events

Backend events are the triggers that happen on the **server**. They are the result of an event being scheduled, an event being set to repeat at a set interval, changes made in the database or an API request from an external app. Backend events will trigger regardless of whether a page is open.

- **General events** - general events are triggered by one of the following:
   - An API request coming from internally in your app or an external app
   - A recurring event that's scheduled to run at a specific time, and from there on on a specific interval, such as weekly
   - A database trigger event, which triggers if a specific change is happening in the database
- **Custom events** - custom events are events that can be triggered by another workflow, to avoid duplicating workflows that you use in multiple places

Article: [Backend events](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/workflows/events/backend-events)​

 Frontend events

The section covers frontend events, which are the events that are triggered on a page.

Frontend events are the triggers that happen on a **page.** It's often – but not always – initiated by a user. Frontend events will only trigger as long as the page is open.

Frontend events can still lead to actions happening on the server – but the *event* (or trigger) happens on the page.

Element events

One of the first and most basic types of triggers are the result of actions taken by the users of your app directly by interacting with an element. For example, a user could click the *Submit* or *Save* button in order to start a sequence of actions that saves the values the user has provided in the database.

Element events include:

- Button/icon/other element clicked
- ​Input form values being updated
- An element hits an error​

Adding more elements (and elements from plugins) can add to the list of possible element events.

Example: Button click

Let's first have a look at one of the most fundamental events an app can have: responding to the click of a button. First, we'll add an element of the type *Button* to the page:

![CleanShot 2023-03-16 at 13.01.48.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FzaNLaYPJ4zerHUg3xCfY%2FCleanShot%202023-03-16%20at%2013.01.48.png?alt=media&token=dde3b632-f97c-4587-902e-e0d767ca1058)

Next, we'll use one of Bubble's shortcuts to assign an event to the button:

![add-event-to-button.gif](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FeQ60xsLDl20winN2xzYg%2Fadd-event-to-button.gif?alt=media&token=44cf2e42-f198-4a43-b982-ca525554990b)

To add a workflow to a button, right-click it and select *Start/edit workflow*. Keep in mind that an event is the first step of a workflow. As soon as you click it, you will be taken to the workflow editor:

![add-actions-to-workflow@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FkJaVANOGOMaxeHsW7pzY%2Fadd-actions-to-workflow%402x.png?alt=media&token=b689e35c-8e7e-4b82-914e-b8392b796a31)

You will see that a workflow has been created with an event. At the top of it is the word *When* followed by an auto-generated label: *When Button A is clicked*. You can then proceed to add actions to the workflow by clicking *Click here to add an action*.

Example: Input value changed

In the next example, we'll look at how you can set up a workflow to run whenever the user changes the value provided in an input form. Changes are registered in two different ways:

- Text-based elements: Whenever the element loses focus
- Click-based elements (such as dropdowns and calendars): Whenever the user confirms their choice with a click

We'll start again with adding an element. Pick one of the elements in the *Input form* category; we're going with a regular text input element:

![create-input-element@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Frs3EtL99S3ZtzmMU1I6p%2Fcreate-input-element%402x.png?alt=media&token=b35b2d73-c6bd-4098-ad1f-6579bcd21feb)

We'll use a shortcut this time too. In the case of input elements, we can also use the Start/edit workflow *to* create an event. Bubble will recognize the element type and automatically set the event to respond to the element's value being updated:

![start-workflow-input-form@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FFepnpkRHayQrMNux9cJj%2Fstart-workflow-input-form%402x.png?alt=media&token=5488f857-0273-4e62-8a66-4eac19fb2bba)

Again you will be taken to the workflow editor and there will be a new workflow automatically labelled by the event:

![input-value-changed-workflow@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FD2QW3hA3Zk8BTlZbnSbC%2Finput-value-changed-workflow%402x.png?alt=media&token=64e0888b-7f8f-45c3-ad97-f9d012f214d8)

You can then proceed to add the needed actions in response the input's value being changed.

Video lessons

To automatically save changes to the database when an input form's value is changed, you can also use auto-binding. This will save the value without the need to set up a workflow.

Article section: [Auto-binding](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/creating-saving-and-deleting-datauto-binding)​

Example: catching errors

Sometimes, trying to run a workflow in Bubble will result in an error. For example, a user might be trying to log in, but provide the wrong credentials. In this case, Bubble will by default alert the user in a browser-standard message:

![login-error.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FihYy5BdJUSeCgC1fI4cR%2Flogin-error.png?alt=media&token=84cd0916-efb9-422f-996f-d014f41d6b90)

System errors will result in a standard error message like this in Chrome, but you can override that message by setting up an event to catch it. Click the image to enlarge.

The An element hits an error event is connected to the workflow that triggered the event. In other words, if the user entered the wrong password, the *Log in* button is the trigger – not the input field, since the button is the one that triggers the workflow where the error happened.

We want to show an alert that we are free to style as we want, so let's first add an *Alert* element to the page and set it to appear at the top of the page:

![alert-top@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F7roR1AZb2sX2U35vqKVX%2Falert-top%402x.png?alt=media&token=d87fd6e1-750f-4ab6-98de-4452f8350066)

Checking the *Position the alert at the top* box lets us stick the alert to the top of the screen regardless of scrolling position.

Then, we'll create the event/workflow. This time we'll need to create it in the workflow editor:

![element-error-workflow.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FfMLTqnsyskC5wMyT33Rg%2Felement-error-workflow.png?alt=media&token=5a2f201a-ed67-4e19-bde9-31c6b5fea719)

Keep in mind that for the error workflow to work, we also need the original workflow (1)

- First, we'll need the original workflow that lets a user log in. Add an action to the button like we did in the [first example](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/workflows/events/frontend-eventexample-button-click).
- Then, add the *An element has an error running a workflow* action and pick the *Log in* button

Now we have the event set up to trigger every time a workflow initiated by the *Log in* button leads to an error. Let's set it up to show the alert and use Bubble's original error message:

![error-message-and-code@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FII96MqqTE5MpJACtGqqC%2Ferror-message-and-code%402x.png?alt=media&token=87af2ca9-110f-4c4a-b05a-d29da7aaca9b)

In this workflow, the data source *Current workflow error* becomes available. By picking the *message* operator we can show the relevant error message.

Identifying and changing error messages

General events

General events are events that are triggered by something happening on the page that is not directly related to an element. It's not necessarily (but can be) the result of a user action:

When the page is loaded or URL refreshed

Whenever the page is loaded or the URL refreshed (such as adding URL parameters) with the *Go to page* action, this event will trigger. This is useful for things that need to happen immediately whenever a user loads the page.

Keep in mind that as the *Go to page* action will trigger this even if the page is not technically reloaded, you may end up triggering it more times than you intended. Use a condition to avoid this.

The user is logged in or out

This event will trigger whenever the user's login status changes and is useful for redirecting users that are logged out for example. It will also trigger on page load according to the login status you provide, meaning that if you instruct Bubble to go to another page if the user is logged out, that event will immediately trigger when the user tries to load the page.

Note that the *Log out user's other sessions* launched from another device may not trigger the event immediately, but will trigger it once the user takes some further action on the page.

An unhandled error occurs

This event in principle does the same as the above-mentioned *An element hits an error,* but applies more broadly: *any* error, regardless of the element (if any) that caused it, will trigger it and allow you to run some actions in response. This is useful if the response you want is an error message for example; by not binding it to a specific element, you can catch all errors in one event.

Video lessons

When a condition is true

Triggering an event when a condition is true uses conditional expressions to check whether something is true or false in real-time. This is a powerful feature that lets you set up logical rules that trigger a workflow instantly whenever the expression returns a *yes*.

Video lessons

Example: Conditional expression

Let's use the *When a condition is true* event combined with a conditional expression to make something happen. This time, instead of logging in, we'll change it to signing up: when the user has provided both an email and a password, we'll animate the *Sign up* button to encourage the user to click it.

Add two input fields (for email and password) and a button for signing up. Make sure you set the *Content format* on each of the fields to Email and Password respectively. Then, we'll set up the event to catch it. We don't only want the input fields to not be empty; we want them to be *valid*.

First, add the event. You'll find this under *General events*:

![do-when-condition-is-true@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FUkWBsDFfM0xPLkygQviv%2Fdo-when-condition-is-true%402x.png?alt=media&token=8747f7d2-7ce6-4888-8e4a-27fabdba8d65)

Then, we'll set up the expression that checks the input fields:

![inputs-valid-expression@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FNDchMAxzBsK8tJvzOkVb%2Finputs-valid-expression%402x.png?alt=media&token=398a2c0c-3bad-46b6-9aa0-9fee39c3010f)

- We're fine with the animation appearing just once, so we'll leave the *Run this* dropdown set at *Just once*.
- In the expression we are checking both inputs, and using an *and* operator to make sure that *both* inputs need to be valid, as opposed to just one (in which case we would have used the *or* operator). We need to check four things in this expression to make it work the way we want:
   - Input Email's value must not be empty (meaning it must contain text)
   - Input Email must be valid (meaning it must be a valid email)
   - Input Password's value must not be empty
   - Input Password must be valid (technically, all passwords are valid, but you can choose to set a required password strength for example)
- We then use the *Animate an element* to animate the button. We chose the subtle *Callout pulse* animation for this

 Recurring workflows

This section covers recurring client-side workflows

[](https://youtu.be/AdB0V7LFe_g)

If you need to run a workflow multiple times with a set interval in-between, you an use a *Do every 5 seconds* event.

![do-every-x-seconds-menu@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fjb1i3Vlx2244NsnBGr6o%2Fdo-every-x-seconds-menu%402x.png?alt=media&token=20586eb0-288a-4519-b85e-c6bb7a45eb6e)

The **5** is flexible, so you can set it to any number of seconds that you want, including decimals, and the workflow will keep running until you stop or the page is closed.

![do-every-x-seconds-bubble@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FvsgtjFv7v7qDocreJKep%2Fdo-every-x-seconds-bubble%402x.png?alt=media&token=473f4d59-9f42-49c2-bf32-e99ebc8ca372)

Keep in mind that continuously repeating a a workflow can potentially slow down your app (depending on what the workflow is doing), especially as your app scales with more users.

We recommend that you mostly use this event for client-side actions, and that you do careful testing to see how it affects your app performance-wise if you are using server-side actions like database operations.

If you want to run a workflow continuously even if the page is closed, you may consider using recursive API workflows instead. Note that they can only run server-side actions.

 Custom events

This section covers Custom events. They are events that can be triggered by other workflows to avoid duplicating workflows, as well as triggered inside a reusable element.

This article covers frontend Custom events – there are also custom events available in the backend.

Custom events are events that can only be triggered by using the *Trigger a custom event* action. In other words, they have to be triggered by another workflow. They can accept parameters that can be referenced in the action steps inside of the workflow.

You can trigger custom events that are on the same page, or inside of a reusable element that's directly placed on the page you are currently working on by using the *Trigger a custom event from a reusable element* action.

What are custom events for?

Custom events have several useful properties:

Avoid repeating work

Since custom events can be called from anywhere on the page, you can avoid having to duplicate workflows.

For example, let's say you have an application that handles documents; you have one *Save* menu option under *File - Save*, and another as an icon in a toolbar. The two do exactly the same thing; they save the contents of a input field to the database.

Instead of using two identical workflows to save the document, you can place the actions needed to save it in a custom event, and trigger that workflow from both places.

Maintain consistency and prepare for future changes

Custom events also help you standardize things that happen in your application. Let's say for example that you use a popup container to show messages to your users such as *The changes have been saved.* By using a custom event to show that popup, you can ensure that it looks and behaves the same no matter what the message is. Should you later decide to move away from a popup and instead use an Alert element you can make that change in just one workflow and it will be replaced all across the page.

Control the order of operations in a workflow

Custom events give you a more fine-grained control over the order of operations in a workflow.

Article section: [The order in which actions are triggered](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/workflows/actionthe-order-in-which-actions-are-triggered) Video: [Understanding workflow execution rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbhCrciOKHM&t=41s)​

Creating a custom event

To create a custom event, first navigate to the *Workflow* *editor*, and click *Click here to add an event... .* From the dropdown menu, pick *Custom* and *Create a new custom event.*

![create-custom-event@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FmUzQNrd92fjawyJVVjfo%2Fcreate-custom-event%402x.png?alt=media&token=21686cdf-189f-4670-9f28-b00addf59e3c)

You will be taken to the workflow properties where we can assign some parameters. We'll use this workflow to change the name of a specificed user, with the *user* and the *name* as parameters:

![custom-event-exampe@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FWhnVFYwjul1rP7xOd3c2%2Fcustom-event-exampe%402x.png?alt=media&token=b549fdc3-b084-4893-be4e-96257368e7ca)

- First, we give the event a *name*. The name doesn't affect how it works, but it's useful to make it descriptive and easy to recognize
- Then, we'll set up two parameters by clicking the *Add a new parameter* button. Parameters let you pass any kind of data to the workflow, and use that information in actions inside of that workflow.
   - First, we'll pass a user: that is the user who's name we want to change
   - Then, we'll pass a text: this is the new name that the user will be given

Now we have a custom event that accepts two things: a user and a text. Let's reference those in an action:

![custom-event-action-example@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FmeUU8RuuLUiGgG5xito6%2Fcustom-event-action-example%402x.png?alt=media&token=4e468b43-85aa-4249-a0cb-5b440ffa6917)

We'll add a *Make changes to a thing* action. In the *thing to change* we choose *user,* which is the name we gave the first parameter. Then we pick the *Name* field on the user, and set it to *text*, which is the name of the second parameter.

This way, we have set up a custom event that can change the name of *any* user by asking for it as a parameter.

By setting up custom events for key workflows in your app, you can make sure they work consistently and are not duplicated across your app.

Running a custom event

Triggering

A custom event can be triggered instantly by using the *Trigger a custom event* action.

![trigger-custom-event@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FOvElVUmY2pxeNQNhqs4w%2Ftrigger-custom-event%402x.png?alt=media&token=a8e3630a-b6e6-431a-9980-0c807f3e6453)

Trigger a workflow in a reusable element

By placing a custom event inside of a reusable element, that workflow can be triggered from the parent of that reusable element. For example, if you have a page called *index* and you place a reusable element called *popup-message* on that page, you can trigger any custom event inside of *popup-message* from the index page (and any other page where you place the reusable element).

**Note:** Triggering custom workflows works only in one direction: from the parent page to the child reusable element.

Scheduling

A custom event can also be scheduled to run at a specific time by using the *Schedule a Custom event* action and providing a number of seconds of delay before the event should trigger.

Scheduling a custom event is a client-side action, and consequently it will not run if the page is closed. If you want to schedule a workflow to run even if the user has closed the app, you can use server-side API workflows:

Article series: [The Workflow API](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api)​

Article: Scheduling [API Workflows](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/api-workflows/scheduling-api-workflows)​

FAQ: Custom events

Is there a difference between triggering a custom event and scheduling a custom event to occur with a 0 second delay?

Yes, there is.

Let's say you have a parent workflow that has some actions, then a "Trigger a custom event" action, then some more actions. When the parent runs that Trigger action, the parent will pause and wait for the custom event to complete before running the actions that come after it. This is convenient in part because the custom event will be able to see the context of what happened in the actions before it in the parent workflow.

In contrast, if you schedule the custom event to occur with delay 0, that custom event could end up running in parallel to the rest of the parent workflow.

How are custom events executed?

Whenever a custom event is triggered inside of another workflow, the workflow will stop at that point, run the custom event until it is completed, and then move on to the next action in the "parent" workflow. You can use this to control some aspects of how workflows are triggered. You can read more about how workflows are triggered in the link below.

Article section: [The order in which actions are triggered](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/workflows/actionthe-order-in-which-actions-are-triggered)​

----
 Backend events

This section covers backend events, which are events that trigger on Bubble's server

Backend events are the triggers that happen on Bubble's **server**. They can be triggered by a few different conditions:

- They can be scheduled to trigger at a specific time with the *Schedule an API workflow* action
- They can be triggered by an API call from an external app
- They can trigger as a response to a change in the database
- They can be set to run at a specific interval

How are backend events different from frontend events?

Backend events are handled completely by Bubble's server, and does not involve the user's device at all, whereas a frontend event will be passed from the user's device to the server.

This has a few implications, the most important being that they are always accessible. A page will stop doing any work as soon as it's closed, but the server is available 24/7.

- Frontend events are the triggers that happen on a **page.** It's often – but not always – initiated by a user. Frontend events will only trigger as long as the page is open.
- Frontend events can still lead to actions happening on the server – but the *event* (or trigger) happens on the page.

Triggering an event at a specific time

You can schedule a backend event to trigger at a specific time. This is a part of the Bubble Workflow API and is done in the following away:

- In the backend editor, create a new API Workflow that contains all the actions that you need to perform
- Use the *Schedule API Workflow* to set the workflow to run at a specific time.

If you want to learn more about how to create and schedule API Workflows, check out our dedicated articles on these subjects:

Article: [Scheduling API Workflows](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/api-workflows/scheduling-api-workflows)​

Note that the *scheduling* is not the event – the event happens when the workflow is triggered at the specified time. As such, the scheduling can happen both on the frontend and the backend, but the *event* will happen on the backend. As such it's available even if the user closes your app.

Triggering a workflow from an external application

By using the Bubble Workflow API you can also trigger a workflow from an external application. To do this:

- Create an API Workflow in the backend editor, and make sure that *Expose as a public API workflow* is checked
- Set up the external application to send a request to the workflow's endpoint

If you want to learn more about how to create API workflows and expose them to external apps, check out our dedicated articles covering this subject:

Triggering an event when data changes in the database

You can set up an event in the backend to start running a workflow whenever something specific is changed in the database by using Database trigger events. For example, let's say you are running an eCommerce app and you want to send an email whenever a data type called *Order* has a field called *Completed purchase* set to *yes.*

By combining a *Database trigger event* with an expression, you can specify exactly what kind of changes you want the event to respond to and run a workflow accordingly.

- Create a *Database trigger event* in the backend editor
- Specify the conditions for the trigger in the *Only when* field

Running a workflow at a specific interval

There are two ways you can set up workflows to run at an interval such as once per day/week/month:

Recurring events

The settings for recurring events vary based on the plan that you have subscribed to. You can check our pricing comparison page to learn more:

Page: [Bubble pricing](https://bubble.io/pricing/compare)​

​Recurring events are events that are built specifically to trigger:

- Daily
- Weekly
- Monthly
- Quarterly
- Yearly

They consist of two parts:

- The recurring event, which contains the workflow to run and the database thing to run it on
- The action Set/Cancel a recurring event which runs the first instance of the workflow and instructs Bubble at what frequency it should run.

Recursive workflows

Recursive workflows are workflows that re-schedule themselves by using the *Schedule API workflow* as an action and picking the same workflow as the one that contains the action. Since you can set a dynamic time to schedule the next cycle, this gives you a way to set an interval freely.

Recursive workflows are a bit more complicated to set up, but offer more flexibility than Recurring events and are available on lower-tier plans.

To learn more about how to use recursive workflows, you can check out our dedicated article on the subject:

Article: [Recursive workflows](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/api-workflows/recursive-api-workflows)​

Overriding timezones

Overriding timezones in the backend requires that you activate the advanced setting *Enable timezone override controls* in your app's general settings.

Reference: [Application settings: Advanced](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/application-settings/generaadvanced-options)​

Some backend workflows allow you to override the *Current user's current timezone* by setting an alternative timezone with a static or dynamic choice. In practice, the timezone replacement works as following:

- **API Workflows:** override the time zone of the API request
- **Recurring event:** override the time zone in which the recurring event was first scheduled
- **Database trigger event**: Override the time zone in which the change happened (i.e. the user's timezone when the change was made)

This helps you standardize the way in which your app parses and stores data. For example:

- if you parse **1/1/2000 from Eastern Time** and keep the default setting, Bubble will save that date as **1/1/2000 12:00 AM Eastern Time**
- If you instead override the client timezone with Pacific Time, selecting 1/1/2000 will save **1/1/2000 12:00 AM Pacific Time**

This type of timezone standardization is useful in different scenarios:

- Where an external API request includes a timestamp, but not a timezone: you can set a static or dynamic timezone when that call is received to ensure its properly parsed
- Apps that deal with scheduling where the timezone of the scheduled appointment needs to remain constant: for example, if a user books a conference in London from Tokyo, your app can ensure that the timezone used is indeed London and not Tokyo.

Overriding timezones is not just available in backend workflows. It can also be set on individual input forms and on pages.

 Database trigger events

This section covers database trigger events, which are events that trigger whenever some specific data in the database changes

Database trigger events are a type of backend events that trigger whenever some specific data in the database changes. What this means is that whenever something is created, changed or deleted, the event will trigger.

By combining this event with a dynamic expression, you can specify exactly what *kind* of change you want the event to be watching.

Creating a database trigger event

Creating the event

We'll use the following example in this walkthrough: we want to set up a trigger that watches for whenever any *user* changes their email address and perform an action whenever that happens.

Database trigger events are a part of Bubble' backend, which means that the first step in setting them up is to navigate to the backend editor. From there, you click *Click here to add a backend workflow...* and select *New database trigger event.*

![new-database-trigger-event.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FrPaIcZ4GdxeXVys8Ey17%2Fnew-database-trigger-event.png?alt=media&token=2c961a48-c97a-40d4-873f-488575806fbd)

As soon as the database trigger event has been created, Bubble will display the settings for that event:

![database-trigger-settings.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FBaAZ8I0H0ZPqnSjWuqKW%2Fdatabase-trigger-settings.png?alt=media&token=67240861-c05b-42c4-9131-97467ee80379)

- First, let's give it a descriptive name; this is just for your reference and doesn't affect how it works.
- In the *Type* field, we need to pick what data type we want the event to be watching. Since we want the event to trigger whenever a user changes their email, we'll set it to *User.*

Building the expression

The next step is to build the dynamic expression; this is the part that tells Bubble what *kind* of change we want the event to respond to.

While structurally similar to expressions used elsewhere, expressions used in database trigger events are different in that they only give you access to two data sources:

- Thing before change
- Thing after change

In our example, the two data sources would represent the following data:

- The user **before** the data in the database was changed
- The user **after** the data in the database was changed

In other words; the event is responding to a *change* on the user, and it gives us access to the user in question both before and after that change has taken place – all in the same workflow. What does that mean to our expression? It means that we can compare two values: one from before the user was changed, and one from after.

This is how we build the expression to tell Bubble what kind of data to watch: by checking if the email saved on the user *before* the change is the same as the user *after* the change: If not, the workflow triggers.

This is what the expression should look like:

![database-trigger-conditional-expression.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F13kvhbTRezboQbx6We9Y%2Fdatabase-trigger-conditional-expression.png?alt=media&token=7eafa7d0-74f4-4a67-acf7-27f9bb2c2a94)

Click the image to enlarge.

In this expression, the *User before change/User after change* are both data sources, *email* are operators and *is not* is the comparison.

Understanding database trigger events

The event technically always runs – but the expression might stop it

Database trigger events look at *any* change to a data type, and triggers the event if one takes place. Bubble then checks the *Only when* expression and stops the rest of the workflow from running if it returns a negative value (*no*).

This is useful to know for a couple of reasons:

- A database trigger event *without* an *Only when* expression will run on every single change made to that data type
- Setting up a lot of database trigger events without any conditions for running can end up spending more capacity than you intended – exercise care when using and use expressions to stop unneeded workflows from running

Limitations of database trigger Events

Database trigger events come with some built-in limitations:

They run with full administrative privileges

Although you can use "Current User" to see which user, if any, initiated the workflow that changed the thing, trigger workflows run with full administrative privileges and privacy roles are not applied while the trigger is running, so any searches performed during the workflow will return all results, not just the results the current user is allowed to see.

One database trigger event will not trigger a second one, or itself

If a database trigger has an action that makes changes to a thing, that change will not trigger a second trigger event (including the same trigger event). This could lead to an eternal loop of triggers. If you want to ensure that workflows started by a database trigger events *do* trigger secondary events, you can move the actions into an API workflow and schedule that workflow from the trigger workflow.

Making changes to the same thing multiple times in the same workflow will only trigger the event once

If you have a workflow that contains multiple actions that should trigger the event, it will only fire *once* for that workflow.

​

----
 Actions

This section covers actions, which are the steps in a workflow that perform different tasks

Actions are the things that **makes stuff happen** in your app. They are the the part of a workflow that performs a specific task, such as making a change in the database, hiding/showing/animating something on the page or navigating to a different page.

![actions-schema.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FydGrp362nPwWbAV4rsIi%2Factions-schema.jpeg?alt=media&token=cdf183d1-c529-4383-a96f-74c1523fa077)

Actions happen as the result of an *event*_,_ and together, they make up the *workflow*.

> Events determine **when** to do something, and actions determine **what** to do
Actions can be chained together to perform a set of tasks in sequence, and each step can rely on information generated in a previous step. Each step can also be controlled with a dynamic expression that controls whether to run or skip that step, based on specific conditions.

Working with actions

In the Bubble workflow editor, actions are visible as soon as you create or open a workflow by clicking on an event.

![events-and-actions@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FFrxwL8XRvyn0QgNoNCB1%2Fevents-and-actions%402x.png?alt=media&token=79274924-46d3-43d9-a6d2-228e52f30ddb)

Actions are contained within the workflow, and visible when you click an event. Click the image to enlarge.

Creating actions

To add the first action to a workflow, click the *Click here to add an action* rectangle. You will see a list of actions separated into categories.

You can add new actions to use across your app by installing plugins or by adding API calls with the API Connector with *use as* set to *action.*

Article: [The API Connector](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-api-connector)​

As soon as you add or click an action, Bubble will show you the settings for that action. Below is an example from the *Make changes to a thing* action:

![make-changes-to-a-thing-action@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fr3eWG7o50C611im3yTrM%2Fmake-changes-to-a-thing-action%402x.png?alt=media&token=2a96b0cb-1eec-49c4-9b9d-267b6b060ce3)

The *Thing to change* specifies the data source of the thing you want to change. After selecting it, Bubble will display the available fields on that data type. In the example above we change the name of the user by providing a static text value.

Setting conditions for running an action step

A workflow can consist of as many steps as you need, but sometimes you'll need to set some rules that determine whether one of those steps should execute or not. For example, you could have a workflow that requires the user to be logged in in order to run; if they are not, you can show an error message.

For this, you use the **only when** field: as the name suggests, this tells Bubble to *only run this action when...* a condition is true. Conditions are dynamic expressions that provide a *yes* or *no* value, depending on a given set of factors.

This step relies on using **dynamic expressions** to set up **conditions** in order to determine whether to run a workflow or action. If you're not familiar with these concepts, we recommend first reading the articles below:

Article: [Dynamic expressions](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/dynamic-expressions)​

Article section: [Conditions](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/conditiononly-when-conditions-workflow-conditions) (only when)

The order in which actions are triggered

**Note:** Although a workflow is created as a linear set of actions, there is a lot going on behind-the-scenes when a workflow executes. This can sometimes lead to some steps firing before other, earlier steps in some cases.

Some workflows run in the client's browser, while others (such as database operations) need to happen on Bubble's server. Some workflows will happen in both the browser and on the server.

If a workflow includes a mix of actions from these three categories, the order in which they are triggered may differ from the linear design in the workflow because of what's firing in the browser versus the server.

The points below offer insights into Bubble's workflow logic along with some general recommendations. It is worth mentioning that the terms "steps" and "actions" are used interchangeably, although in the given examples, "steps" are used when the order is significant.

For efficiency purposes, workflows run in parallel across the server and the front end. Despite the names "Step 1," "Step 2," it is important to note that a given step does not necessarily wait for the previous one to complete before triggering the next one. The following is some information about Bubble workflow logic and general recommendations. Please also note that steps and actions are used interchangeably, but steps may be used in these examples when the order is important to note.

General rules about how workflows run:

- Frontend workflow actions run in order but the next action does not wait on the previous action to be complete before triggering.
- Backend workflows are triggered as soon as the workflow is triggered, independently from steps. For example, a "Schedule API Workflow" action will be triggered as soon as the workflow is triggered even if it is placed last in the workflow action sequence.
- Custom events run in sequence, not parallel. If Workflow 1 triggers a custom event that starts Workflow 2, Workflow 2 will complete before the remaining actions in Workflow 1 run.
- Searches aren’t always immediately updated with new data. So if you create a new item, and then try to retrieve it via search, it may or may not work; you should not rely on this.
   - Retrieving a thing from “result of step X” where step X is the “Create…” step should always be safe.

Workarounds to help achieve workflow consistency:

- When a workflow trigger (e.g. a button) can have multiple results based on conditions, it is safer to create multiple workflows and place the conditions at the workflow level instead of creating one workflow with all possible actions and placing the conditions at the action level.
- In a workflow with two actions, if Step 2 is using a condition based on a search depending on data manipulated in Step 1, then Step 1 should be implemented into a custom event to make sure it is finished before moving on to Step 2.
- If a backend workflow should be triggered after other steps in the workflow, then it should be implemented in a custom event placed after the steps that need to come first.
- The safest way to use data from one step to another is to use the “Result of step X” operators instead of searches.
- We do not offer the explicit ability for an action to wait for a workflow to be over before moving on to the next step; however, using "add a pause before next action" action is usually an effective workaround.

Video lessons

Using data from a previous step

[](https://youtu.be/D3ks42piYww)

Sometimes an action needs to refer to an earlier step in the same workflow. If you do this by referring to it *indirectly*, there is a risk that the change you initiated has not yet had time to update and may not be reflected in the later step. Let's look at an example to illustrate this:

Let's say you are using the *Make changes to a thing* to save some information to a data type called *Product*. In a later step, you refer to that same product by using *Do a search for* and narrowing it down with the *first item* operator:

![order-of-operations@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FyV38tPUovSuMikMghvDK%2Forder-of-operations%402x.png?alt=media&token=842741df-ea24-438e-aaef-454d83fb728d)

- In this example we are first changing the name of the Product
- And then we use the *Set state of an element* to save that name in a custom state

In this case, there is a slight risk that the first operation (Make changes to a thing) has not yet had time to complete until the Do a search for finds and returns data; as such, the custom state could be saving the name of the thing *before* it was changed.

To avoid this, you can use the Result of step 1 data source. Not only do you not have to perform the search, but when you use this step, Bubble ensures that the operation done in Step 1 is completed before any later steps that rely on information from it are executed.

Help us improve this article

This article is part of a significant update to the Bubble manual and your feedback is critical to our efforts to continuously enhance our written documentation. We would greatly appreciate if you could take a moment to let us know your thoughts on the quality of it. Thank you for your support! [Give feedback on this article](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfe7eaYVxkqTa_nn3QE6VObCxWB1hgh6sHUQGQ0Eit8JlAS7g/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.619913899=https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/apis-connect-to-other-apps/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/api-workflows&entry.80834677=API+Workflows)​

API workflows are server-side workflows that you can schedule/trigger in your application and/or expose to be triggered from an external application or system through an API request.

They run independently of any page, which means they can be executed without anyone visiting your app. By making an API request to the server that hosts your Bubble app, you can create things, sign users up and send emails – anything you can do with a regular workflow.

Whenever an event occurs in an external app and the application sends an HTTP request to your app, this is often described as a webhook. This allows you to start a process in your application, such as sending a welcome email or adding the user to a newsletter list.

Just like the [data API](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-data-api), these requests need to be pointed towards a specific resource. Bubble automatically creates a URL for each API workflow that you choose to expose. It follows then, that these too are incoming requests – they are coming into your app from somewhere else.

Activating and accessing the backend workflow editor

API Workflows versus regular workflows

There are several key differences between an API Workflow and a regular Workflow:

| **Action**                                       | **API Workflow**                             | **Regular workflow**           |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Can be triggered from an external application    | Yes                                          | No                             |
| Will continue running even if the page is closed | Yes                                          | No                             |
| Can schedule itself to loop                      | Yes                                          | No                             |
| Can be scheduled to run in the future            | Yes, and will run even if the page is closed | Yes, but page must remain open |
| Can override privacy rules                       | Yes                                          | No                             |
| Are executed 100% server-side                    | Yes                                          | No                             |

Using server-side workflows

Setting up workflows that run server-side is useful in several situations:

**Security**

Since the workflow is executed away from the page and user, it’s more secure. One of the main principles of web development is that any kind of process that is performed on the page can technically be intercepted by a savvy user, whereas an action happening on the server can be kept securely hidden away from prying eyes. This is not to say that all workflows triggered on a page are insecure, only that the user of the device may be able to see what’s going on. In most cases this is not a problem, but in some corner cases you should be mindful of where the process takes place.

Let’s say for example that you want to generate a random string of text to send to the user as an extra means of authentication. If you generate that code in a workflow on the page that the user is looking at, the user might be able to see the string that has been generated and circumvent the security measure. This string should be generated and emailed in a backend workflow, since the user can’t see what’s going on on the server.

Performance

API Workflows technically spend the same amount of workload as a regular Workflow, but you can still use it to your advantage to make your app seem more performant to your Users. Since any action that takes place on the server does not cause any performance degradation on a Users page, you can move complex workflows to the server to keep your pages lightweight and its code base minimal.

Keep in mind the following as you plan for performance:

- While an API workflow doesn't create noticeable slowdown for users, it still adds to the total workload of your app.
- Scheduling an API Workflow is in itself a process that can take a few moments to complete - for simpler workflows it's sometimes quicker to simply complete the actions in the page workflow.

Everything that you add to a page (elements, workflows and conditions) will add to the total size of the page that the browser has to download. By moving parts of it to the backend, you can keep your page as lightweight as possible. Keep in mind that API workflows also spend your app's workload, so moving workflows into the backend only affects the loading time and size of the page.

**Bulk operations**

API workflows are also where you can set up heavier workloads where you need to make changes to a high volume of data. There are a few reasons for why it makes sense to move processes to the backend:

- Processes running in the backend will continue to run until they are finished, whereas on-page workflows will stop running if the user closes their browser
- Backend workflows can schedule themselves, meaning that you can loop them. This is useful when you need to process a list of database things
- Complex on-page workflows can slow down the front-end of your app, but if run in the backend your users will not notice

**Using API Workflows internally**

Using API Workflows internally is done in two steps. First you need to create the API Workflow, and then you need to use the *Schedule API Workflow* action to schedule or trigger it. The two articles below describe both parts of the process.

First you will need to create the API Workflow that you want to trigger/schedule:

[Creating API workflows](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/api-workflows/creating-api-workflows)

Then you need to use the *Schedule API Workflow* action to schedule the workflow at the current time or in the future:

[Scheduling API workflows](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/api-workflows/scheduling-api-workflows)

If you want to run a sequential loop of workflows or schedule it to run at a given interval you can also consider using recursive workflows:

[Recursive API workflows](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/api-workflows/recursive-api-workflows)

**Exposing API Workflows for external use**

After an API Workflow has been created and set up to be [exposed as a public API Workflow](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/api-workflows/creating-api-workflowexposing-the-workflow-externally) you can trigger it from an external application by use of an API request. The articles below explain how to create API Workflows, as well as how to authenticate with the Bubble API.

First you will need to create the API Workflow you want to be able to trigger:

[Creating API workflows](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/api-workflows/creating-api-workflows)

Before you can access your workflow from an external system you need to decide what kind of authentication you want to implement:

[Authentication](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/authentication)

Finally you can send a request to your application by directing the external app towards the correct API Workflow endpoint:

[Workflow API endpoints]([https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/workflow-api-endpoints](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/workflow-api-endpoints) )

Our webinar gives an introduction to how API workflows work

Creating an API Workflow works in the same way as creating regular workflows in on a page. After [activating the Workflow API](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-apactivating-the-workflow-api) and [accessing the backend editor](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-apaccessing-the-backend-workflow-editor) you click *Click here to add a backend workflow* and choose *New API workflow.*

![create-api-workflow.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FanQBfmYcqv0XkpsVBcri%2Fcreate-api-workflow.png?alt=media&token=5ec42dd0-0dfa-4fc6-bdee-8d9778b8a4a6)

Click *New API Workflow* to create.

The endpoint

For each API workflow that you create and expose a unique endpoint is created, consisting of your app's Worfklow API root URL and the name that you give the workflow.

The root URL is made visible in the Bubble editor as soon as you [activate the Workflow API](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-apactivating-the-workflow-api) as illustrated below:

![enable-workflow-api-bubble.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FfHlMmESlz4YRLlVllWiM%2Fenable-workflow-api-bubble.png?alt=media&token=5f0db313-e018-4234-bf11-d4321ea6aded)

Activating the Workflow API in Bubble's API Settings. exposes the root URL of your API workflows.

Naming your workflows

The complete API Workflow endpoint is constructed by combining the root URL with the name. As a consequence, the name of the API needs to be in a URL-friendly format:

- each API Workflow needs to have a **unique name**
- use **lowercase letters**
- **remove spaces and special characters** (replacing them with dashes or underscores)
- remove any trailing or leading **white space**
- don't make the name **too long**

For example, instead of naming a workflow Create New User, you would name it create-new-user.

Constructing the endpoint

Having activated the Workflow API and given our workflow a name, we can now construct the complete endpoint:

[https://my-bubble-application.bubbleapps.io/version-test/api/1.1/wf/create-new-user](https://my-bubble-application.bubbleapps.io/version-test/api/1.1/wf/create-new-user)

Labelling your workflows

While the name of the workflow needs to be URL friendly, you are still free to provide a more humanly readable label for it. The API Workflow will automatically inherit its label from the name, but you can change this label as you see fit to make it easier to read and search for.

![api-workflow-name-label.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FDj5GL68pqSt0qfIUG1zO%2Fapi-workflow-name-label.png?alt=media&token=f188e08b-f374-49c9-90fc-3f50c9196715)

Giving your API Workflow a different label makes it easier to work with and search for.

Exposing the workflow externally

Having created and named our Workflow, we need to make sure that it is exposed outside of your application, or the endpoint will simply return an error.

![expose-api-workflow.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FpjgMSoFhx758C4GVuhQu%2Fexpose-api-workflow.png?alt=media&token=a5536852-7423-4e03-a085-ffabf5adaab6)

To be reachable from outside of your own app, this box needs to be checked.

Check the *Expose as public API workflow* box to give external applications access to the endpoint.

Only expose API Workflows that you intend to trigger from an external system. If you will only use the workflow as part of your own app's internal processes, keep the box unchecked.

Overriding authentication

Just like the Data API, API Workflows require that the client authenticates themselves before the workflow will trigger.

![run-api-workflow-without-authentication.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FEBeOhHeupHGQ0jpGU1Zb%2Frun-api-workflow-without-authentication.png?alt=media&token=b1f8f82f-faef-4205-af9e-202dfb91f12d)

To set up an API Workflow to be accessible by anyone, check the *This workflow can be run without authentication* checkbox. Keep in mind that Privacy Rules can still limit the functionality of the API Workflow.

Be cautious when opening up API Workflows to be accessible without authentication as this will allow anyone to trigger the workflow at any time.

Defining the HTTP method

The HTTP method determines what kind of action the client instructs the server to perform. By default, API Workflows use the POST HTTP method, but some external systems require the ability to use the GET method for webhooks. To switch between the two, click the *Trigger workflow with* dropdown.

If you select to trigger the API Workflow with a GET request, the parameter definition will default to *Manual Definition*, and the field will be hidden. You can still define key-value pairs as normal.

If you are using API workflows via the App Connector, these workflows will automatically be triggered by the proper HTTP request defined in “Trigger workflow with” dropdown.

When you switch between GET and POST, the definitions and parameters you’ve defined will be preserved. The contents for *Detect request data* will be saved if you decide to switch between the different options of *Parameter Definition*. The Bubble issue checker will ensure the data is correctly formatted

Defining parameters

In many cases an API Workflow will need some parameters to run. Let's say for example that you the workflow is set up to create a new User in your app, you will need to include key information like email and perhaps a first and last name. Using parameters you can send this information to the workflow from outside of Bubble.

You have two ways to define parameters:

- define the structure yourself
- automatically detect the structure of the received data

The first option is better for an API workflow you define and when you control how the request is made (for instance when you use scheduled workflows, or build a custom client), while the second option is useful when using the API workflow's endpoint as a response to a webhook.

Manual definition

Adding a parameter goes through three steps:

- Give the parameter a name
- Pick the type of data you will receive
- Specify whether the parameter is optional or not

Both the type of data and optionality are important settings: Bubble will validate the data when a request is made and if a parameter is sent with the wrong formatting or a non-optional parameter is missing, Bubble will return an error.

![workflow-parameters.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F2U6aL6ULXBWnvSnhLrD4%2Fworkflow-parameters.png?alt=media&token=4c91e065-72f4-485e-a07c-d3ff6461bdf9)

In the example above we have include three parameters of type text to create a User:

- Email (required)
- First name (required)
- Last name (required)
- Nickname (optional)

Automatic detection

Bubble can also automatically detect the parameters that are sent by an external service (webhook). It does this by "listening" for the incoming request and checking the parameters that are sent in the call – that way it can identify each one and attempt to determine what kind of data type it is.

To do this, you need to make a small amendment in the endpoint URL to let Bubble know that this is an initialization call.

![detect-api-parameters@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F1GZMJPlI8VaJThKRHpIr%2Fdetect-api-parameters%402x.png?alt=media&token=52233520-be19-4e0d-bf4d-329bb3e09365)

Bubble can automatically detect the parameters in your call by using the *Detect data* feature.

To automatically detect data, do the following:

- In the API Workflow inspector window, set *Parameter definition* to *Detect request data*
- Click *Detect data*
- Bubble will reveal the initialization URL
- Send the request from the external system

Initialization URL

Bubble will show you the URL you need to send the request to, but you can also construct this by yourself:

`https://appname.bubbleapps.io/version-test/api/1.1/wf/endpoint/initialize`

or

`https://yourdomain.com/version-test/api/1.1/wf/endpoint/initialize`

The request should be made to the test version of your app, as it's the version you're modifying. You never need to send an initialization to the live version, as any changes you make to the parameters need to be deployed.

Overriding timezones

Overriding timezones in the backend requires that you activate the advanced setting *Enable timezone override controls* in your app's general settings.

Reference: [Application settings: Advanced](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/application-settings/generaadvanced-options)​

API workflows allow you to override the time zone of the request by setting an alternative timezone with a static or dynamic choice. This helps you standardize the way in which your app parses and stores data. For example:

- if you parse **1/1/2000 from Eastern Time** and keep the default setting, Bubble will save that date as **1/1/2000 12:00 AM Eastern Time**
- If you instead override the client timezone with Pacific Time, selecting 1/1/2000 will save **1/1/2000 12:00 AM Pacific Time**

This type of timezone standardization is useful in different scenarios:

- Where an external API request includes a timestamp, but not a timezone: you can set a static or dynamic timezone when that call is received to ensure its properly parsed
- Apps that deal with scheduling where the timezone of the scheduled appointment needs to remain constant: for example, if a user books a conference in London from Tokyo, your app can ensure that the timezone used is indeed London and not Tokyo.

Returning data from the API Workflow

Sometimes you'll want your app to return data after a workflow has been triggered. In most cases, to respond with data from your database you will want to use the Data API, but sometimes you need more control over what data you send back, such as:

- verifying that a workflow completed successfully
- returning data that depends on the workflow
- combining data/fields from multiple data types

To return data you can use the *Return data from API* action:

![return-data-api@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F571lKLbHnGbYdtTvlAVn%2Freturn-data-api%402x.png?alt=media&token=49546d45-9657-4177-b5ab-2454309cce0d)

In the example above, we have a database Thing where we save a *score*. Let's imagine that we want to return the average score of all *Things* in the database. We can use the *Return data from API* feature to perform a search and return the updated average that depends on Step 1.

 Scheduling API workflows

API Workflows can be triggered or scheduled internally in your app

Help us improve this article

While the Workflow API is useful for building workflows that can be exposed and triggered by external applications and systems, API workflows can also be used to schedule workflows in your application.

Scheduled API workflow use cases

There are many use cases where scheduling an API Workflow is a better alternative than running a workflow on the page.

- When you need to **schedule an action in the future**, such as:
   - Sending an email X number of hours after a User signs up
   - Send a reminder X number of days before an event
   - Terminate a trial one month after it has started
- Schedule **recurring events**, such as
   - Sending a weekly newsletter
   - Calculate and save statistics or aggregations
   - Delete redundant data to clean up the database
- Performing **complex workflows**, such as:
   - Actions that involve complex searches and filtering
   - Workflows that contain a long list of actions that can take some time to complete
- Set up **cascading workflows**, such as:
   - Deleting Things in your database that are connected to other things that also need to be deleted or updated
- Running **bulk workflows** **from the Bubble editor**
   - If you need to quickly change something on a list of things
   - Note that bulk operations only accept one parameter: the list of things on which to perform the operation

How to schedule an API Workflow

After you have built the API Workflow you want to trigger, you schedule it to run at the current date-time or in the future by using the action *Schedule API Workflow*.

![CleanShot 2023-12-01 at 15.56.45.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FWFeBeY0kVowQEYayrEkQ%2FCleanShot%202023-12-01%20at%2015.56.45.png?alt=media&token=9315be55-1cdd-462a-aabc-551e041cfc28)

You pick the API workflow you want to schedule and define the time of the scheduling. You'll be prompted to fill the different parameters that have been defined at the API workflow level.

Note that if you schedule an API workflow in the **past**, it will **trigger immediately**.

Schedule an API Workflow on a list of things

You can also schedule an API workflow on a list of things. This way you are scheduling one workflow per entry in the list.

For example, if you want to run a workflow on 5,000 users, you can use the *Schedule API Workflow on a list of things* action to schedule 5,000 separate API workflows. You can then set up that workflow to perform actions on one user at a time.

While this can be used to run a given workflow separately on each item in a list, it's not technically *looping* – scheduling an API Workflow on a list will schedule one workflow per item, but it will not wait for one to finish before it moves on to the next.

We recommend setting the interval to 0 unless you have a specific reason not to, for Bubble to complete the operation as efficiently as possible. Keep in mind that adding an interval does not guarantee that the workflows will not overlap – see the box below if you need to force your workflows to run sequentially.

If you are looking to create an API Workflow that loops over entries in a list **sequentially**, you can use recursive workflows instead of *Schedule API workflow on a list*.

Note that recursive workflows are slower and cost more WU than *Schedule API workflow on a list.*

To schedule an API Workflow on a list, make sure to define your endpoint with a parameter for a particular Data Type.

![workflow-on-a-list@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FG7RK9Gj5NnVr0G59MmaS%2Fworkflow-on-a-list%402x.png?alt=media&token=4fc77505-314f-4e3f-8c62-626c15ced8e7)

You can define what kind of Data Type you want to schedule the list of Workflows on. In the example above we've set up a parameter with the *User* data type.

Then, when you schedule the API workflow on a list, you'll choose the type of thing, the list to run on, and for the parameter you'll be able to choose "this thing".

![schedule-workflow-on-a-list-of-users@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FKhEofaf2Opg9tRwBsA0u%2Fschedule-workflow-on-a-list-of-users%402x.png?alt=media&token=02fc0559-f106-4a07-b992-fcc2baf68535)

By setting the *Type of things* to the Data Type we created a parameter for, we can run the workflow once for every User we find in the *Search for user* list result.

The API workflow well then run in the context of this thing for each thing in the list.

Canceling a scheduled workflow

The Bubble editor also retains a list of scheduled API workflows where you can view, pause and cancel individual or all scheduled workflows. See more in the article below:

Article: [The API workflow scheduler](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/maintaining-an-application/scheduler)​

Whenever you schedule an API workflow Bubble generates a unique ID for that specific instance. The *Schedule API workflow* returns that ID so that you can reference that in a later step in the same workflow:

![save-workflow-id.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F5tqD0JnIpfID23MEIk9Q%2Fsave-workflow-id.png?alt=media&token=8870e85a-e7f7-4918-b886-3d3411f4a9c9)

Scheduling an API Workflow returns a unique ID that you can use in the next step. In this example we're saving the ID on the Current User-

You can use this ID to cancel the API workflow at any time before it is scheduled to run by using the *Cancel a scheduled API Workflow* action.

To cancel a list of scheduled Workflows you can use the *Cancel a list of scheduled API Workflows* action.

 Recursive API workflows

This section describes what recursive workflows are and how to set them up

Help us improve this article

In most scenarios, when using API workflows to process a list of things, *Schedule API workflow on a list* will be a more efficient method, both in terms of completion time and WU consumption. We generally recommend using *Schedule API workflow on a list,* for bulk processing, but there are cases where recursive workflows will give you more flexibility.

Article: [Scheduling API workflows](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/api-workflows/scheduling-api-workflows)​

API workflows can be set up to be recursive, meaning that they re-schedule themselves as part of the workflow. This is not a Bubble feature per sé but a method of combining Bubble’s backend features to solve specific problems.

By having an API workflow reschedule itself, you can open up for:

- Looping a workflow to perform processing on a list of things in sequence (as opposed to finishing each as fast as possible)
- Setting up workflows that automatically run at set or flexible intervals​
- Setting up process where a workflows relies on data from a previous cycle of that workflow (by passing dynamic parameters to the next "cycle" of the workflow)

**Processing a list of things**

Keeping in mind the points above, recursive workflows are a useful alternative to *Schedule API workflow on a list* in some cases.

For example; by using a recursive workflow, we can instruct Bubble to go over each item one by one and we can set up a customizable delay in-between each iteration if needed. This can be less than a second, or months/years in-between, depending on your needs.

Imagine that you have a list of items that you need to process one by one. You could use a recursive workflow to process the items.

- First, set up an API Workflow with a parameter containing the data type you want to process. Make sure to check the *Is list/array* to tell Bubble that we are passing a list of things rather than a single record. For this example, we’ll call the parameter rentalunits and set the data type to Rental Units.
- Now add the action that you want to perform. For this example we’ll simply generate a random string for the name of the rental unit. Set the Thing to change to rentalunits:first item. This way we’ll make the change on the first item in the list.
- Now we’ll change the Unit name field by using the Calculate Randomstring feature
- Our next step is what makes this a recursive workflow. We’ll now use the Schedule API Workflow to make the workflow run again. Three points are important to include:
   - First, we schedule the workflow using the regular *Schedule API workflow* action.
   - Secondly, we need to pass the same list as was originally passed to the request, but remove the first item. This way we make sure that it goes on to work on the next item in the list in the upcoming loop. We do this by passing the parameter rentalunits:minus item:rentalunits:first item
   - Then, we need to add a condition that checks whether there is a next item. We do this by counting the number of items left after the first one has been removed: rentalunits:minus item:rentalunits:first item:count > 0. This condition makes sure that the workflow doesn’t loop forever but stops when the count is zero.

**Running at intervals**

To set up a workflow to run at set or flexible intervals, you simply set the rescheduling action to user the *current date/time* + any value that you want in-between the cycles. For example, setting the schedule action to use the *current date/time + months:1* will ensure that the cycle runs exactly once every month from the time it is scheduled.

​

----
 API workflow scheduler

This section covers the scheduler, which lets you view, pause and delete upcoming scheduled workflows

A scheduled workflow (known as an API workflow) is a workflow that is scheduled to run on the Bubble server at a specific time. In the *Logs* tab of your application editor, you can access the scheduler to view all upcoming scheduled workflows.

The Live and Development environments in your app have separate schedules. If you don't see workflows that you expected to be in the list, check that you are looking at the right environment.

How scheduled workflows are queued

The scheduler is a queue, and can be imagined as a funnel. If a funnel is filled with water faster than the rate at which it drains, it will be congested and it will affect its flow. Similarly, if the scheduler is "filled" with a lot of simultaneous or very shortly spaced workflows, the scheduler can be "congested", leading to delays.

Avoiding delays

To avoid delays when working with scheduled workflows, follow the recommendations below:

- The more *heavy* the workload of the workflow, the more server capacity it will use. This is both affected by the number of actions in the workflow, and the complexity of those workflows
   - Database operations that work on a large volume of data (searches (especially with advanced filters) and actions that work on a list of things are particularly taxing
   - A high number of actions, and in particular if they depend on each other (such as using *result of step X*) can also slow things down
- If you are scheduling a big number of workflows (by use of Schedule API Workflow on a list or recursively), it helps to consider spacing them out with some time in-between each cycle. How much time depends on the complexity of the workflow and how much capacity your app has in general
   - If the process does not need to finish at the highest possible speed, you can experiment setting a delay time of several seconds to control the capacity.

Overall, server-side workflow are a very powerful feature, but you may find that you need to experiment a bit to learn how to build workflows that don't overwhelm the system.

Navigating scheduled workflows

To search for scheduled workflows, set a time in the datetime input and click *Show*. Bubble will search for all workflows that are scheduled after the time you have specified. Note that the search can take a little bit of time to finish.

The columns let you see the details for that specific workflow:

**Scheduled time** is the datetime when the workflow is scheduled to run. It will show in the timezone reported by your browser (meaning it may look different to you and the user who scheduled it if you are not in the same timezone).

**ID** is the ID of the scheduled workflow. Every workflow that is scheduled has a unique ID used to identify that workflow.

**API Event** is the event of the workflow, recognized by the label you have given it in the Workflow editor.

**Current user** is the email of the user that scheduled the workflow

**Parameters** include any custom parameters that were provided when the workflow was scheduled

Pause Tasks

Be careful when using the *Pause tasks* feature, as this will stop all API Workflows from running; if you are working in the Live environment and have live users scheduling API workflows, they will not run until *Pause tasks* has been deactivated.

If you are experiencing workflows not running as expected, check this setting.

![CleanShot 2023-03-27 at 14.57.57.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FVYHI4oynjCcwkjEymIWE%2FCleanShot%202023-03-27%20at%2014.57.57.png?alt=media&token=ec8c2149-c6c7-4770-90db-b827508a98bc)

You can delete all past workflows that have not run yet, or scheduled workflows in their entirety.

FAQ: API Workflow scheduler

Does the scheduler show external API requests?

No, since workflow API requests that come from an external app are not *scheduled* but triggered immediately, they will not show up in the scheduler.

What happens if a workflow is scheduled in the past?

An API workflow scheduled in the past will trigger immediately, and as such will not show up in the scheduler.

----
 Case: Stripe notifications

As the API is a way to let external services connect to your app, each case has a different implementation. Here are 3 different examples of how to use the Bubble API in real-life. Note that each example assumes that the app is on a paid plan and the APIs are activated.

![Desktop 2017-03-16 at 2.53.55 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smv0eYcbWMgGLX_Ze%2FDesktop%202017-03-16%20at%202.53.55%20PM.png?generation=1587943314377817&alt=media)

Notifying users when a Stripe subscription charge fails

Having your app take some actions when something happens on another service's end is a typical use case of the Bubble API. This will walk through the different steps, both on Bubble's and Stripe's sides. We'll start with an app that already has the Stripe plugin installed, with the relevant keys entered in the Plugins Tab. We also assume that our payment workflows save the Stripe customer ID of the user on the user - we'll need it to go from the ID Stripe provides to the User thing, and get his/her email.

We assume for this example the domain of the app is

`https://stripeexample.bubbleapps.io`

We'll start on the Bubble side, in the Backend Workflows page accessed via the page navigator in the topnav. We need to define an API Endpoint that will be called whenever Stripe fails to charge a credit card. This API workflow should have an action that sends an email to the customer with a message prompting him or her to update his card. So let's start by creating a new API Event that we'll call 'chargefailed'.

![Desktop 2017-03-16 at 1.28.00 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smv0Nt-I6IKHcfukO%2FDesktop%202017-03-16%20at%201.28.00%20PM.png?generation=1587943312312826&alt=media)

We make this endpoint public, so that Stripe can trigger it via a webhook (see below), and we make it possible to run without authentication for simplicity.

Looking at Stripe's [documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/apevent_object) shows what Stripe sends when it triggers a webhook. Stripe's server will make a request to our endpoint, and send an event ID in the body in the request. Therefore, we're adding an id parameter to our call of type text.

![Desktop 2017-03-16 at 1.36.01 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smv0PPsh95HeeWtYb%2FDesktop%202017-03-16%20at%201.36.01%20PM.png?generation=1587943312731392&alt=media)

We can now start building the Send Email action. We need to do a few things:

- Use a Send email action to send an email to this user.
- Use the Event ID sent by Stripe to retrieve the [Event object](https://stripe.com/docs/apevent_object). This event contains the charge object and the customer ID.
- Perform a search in Bubble to retrieve the user with this customer ID.
- Write a friendly reminder.

We start by adding the action, and will work on the To field. In this process, it's important to think from what we need and go up from there. Therefore, we start with the search for Users, add a constraint on the Customer ID field, and define the value as the result of an API call from Stripe. Here is the search.

![Desktop 2017-03-16 at 1.43.23 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smv0Ravf6rrGnMz3U%2FDesktop%202017-03-16%20at%201.43.23%20PM.png?generation=1587943312684996&alt=media)

To get the Customer ID of the prevent event. The Stripe plugin offers a call to retrieve an Event object from an Event ID. Doing a call to Stripe will validate the Event ID, and will return the Event object. From this object, we can get the Stripe Customer ID. So what we need here is the data source 'Get Data from an API'.

![Desktop 2017-03-16 at 1.44.39 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smv0TbWV0cbnLTCRu%2FDesktop%202017-03-16%20at%201.44.39%20PM.png?generation=1587943313116351&alt=media)

The API call is 'Get Stripe event', and the event_id we need to send to Stripe is precisely the one we got from the initial request (the webhook). This parameter is the first entry in the dropdown, we select it.

![Desktop 2017-03-16 at 1.46.06 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smv0VTO-THEjJNvE3%2FDesktop%202017-03-16%20at%201.46.06%20PM.png?generation=1587943312377902&alt=media)

At this stage, we have retrieved the Stripe Event object, we just need to get the Customer ID and our search will be ready.

![Desktop 2017-03-16 at 1.48.02 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smv0XsYHUmg460zsz%2FDesktop%202017-03-16%20at%201.48.02%20PM.png?generation=1587943314688198&alt=media)

We can get back to the To field of the 'Send Email' search, and get the email of the user. Note that a search returns a list of users. In this case, we know the customer ID is specific to each user, but we need to get the first item of the list, to go from a list of one user to the user, and then get the email.

![Desktop 2017-03-16 at 1.50.26 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smv0ZWVN8DETCjxee%2FDesktop%202017-03-16%20at%201.50.26%20PM.png?generation=1587943314355365&alt=media)

We can now finish the action by adding the message we want to send.

![Desktop 2017-03-16 at 1.51.23 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smv0ag8EFAPsyBDyv%2FDesktop%202017-03-16%20at%201.51.23%20PM.png?generation=1587943313394476&alt=media)

We're all set on Bubble's side. Let's summarize what our workflow does:

- Get the Event ID sent by Stripe with the webhook
- Fetch the Event object and get the Customer ID
- Perform a search in the application's database and get the user with this Customer ID
- Send an email to the user that was retrieved by the search.

The full endpoint for this workflow is, as described in the [reference](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/api-workflows/examples-and-walkthroughs).

`https://stripeexample.bubbleapps.io/api/1.1/wf/chargefailed`

We're now heading to Stripe to configure the webhook. What we want: whenever a charge fails, trigger a webhook to this URL. We do this in [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks).

![Desktop 2017-03-16 at 2.02.21 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smv0cTZ60WkxqtWxP%2FDesktop%202017-03-16%20at%202.02.21%20PM.png?generation=1587943313955584&alt=media)

And we're all set! Whenever a charge fails, the webhook is triggered, and Bubble will send an email to the user. You can see the execution of such workflow in your server logs.

Sending a monthly newsletter

This example shows how you can create a system where your users can opt-in and opt-out for a weekly email. We'll cover the logic and the workflows to set up a weekly action, the content of the email will not be covered.

First, we head to the API page of our app and create a new recurring event.

![Desktop 2017-03-16 at 2.55.59 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smv0gmgJp6K1i5fJV%2FDesktop%202017-03-16%20at%202.55.59%20PM.png?generation=1587943314074829&alt=media)

Let's call this event 'Newsletter'. A newsletter subscription is attached to a user, so we pick user as a type of thing.

![Desktop 2017-03-16 at 2.57.34 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smv0ixNb5gVw9SqVV%2FDesktop%202017-03-16%20at%202.57.34%20PM.png?generation=1587943313931134&alt=media)

This workflow will have one action that sends an email to the user that is sent to this workflow (the 'Current Workflow User')

![Desktop 2017-03-16 at 3.00.02 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smv0kwpIIdZsCtYpA%2FDesktop%202017-03-16%20at%203.00.02%20PM.png?generation=1587943313741777&alt=media)

We can now move to the page in your app where we'll offer users the option to opt-in or opt-out from this newsletter. We'll do this in a very simplified 'account' page that shows two buttons.

![Desktop 2017-03-16 at 3.03.00 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smv0mOjHWZjU7JdDR%2FDesktop%202017-03-16%20at%203.03.00%20PM.png?generation=1587943313651443&alt=media)

We need to add two workflows to our page. We assume that in this page, the user is logged in, and won't worry about enforcing this in the example-page.

The first workflow will let users opt-in. It is triggered when the user clicks on the button 'Opt-in', and will use the 'Set/Cancel a recurring event'.

![Desktop 2017-03-16 at 3.06.02 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smv0o9cnGVpnTkHFC%2FDesktop%202017-03-16%20at%203.06.02%20PM.png?generation=1587943314238040&alt=media)

This action takes an event and a thing. In this case, the event is 'Newsletter', and the thing is the Current User. We built the workflow so that the newsletter is sent weekly, starting on the following day at 9am.

![Desktop 2017-03-16 at 3.23.16 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smv0qWr2Sokn0cuPV%2FDesktop%202017-03-16%20at%203.23.16%20PM.png?generation=1587943314354414&alt=media)

The opt-out workflow shares exactly the same structure, except that the frequency will be 'none'. Effectively, this will cancel any scheduled recurring event (and won't do anything if no event is scheduled initially).

![Desktop 2017-03-16 at 3.25.29 PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smv0sK4f7H0DR1dNZ%2FDesktop%202017-03-16%20at%203.25.29%20PM.png?generation=1587943314230905&alt=media)

Writing a script to read data from the database

The GET/Data API lets you read your data programmatically. This can be done by another application, but can also be used in some scripts to save or print your data. This example shows how you can do this in Python. We're writing this script for an app hosted on the domain [yourapp.com](http://yourapp.com), and our goal is to retrieve all invoices. This assume that our app has a type named 'invoice'. We do not add constraints, but it would be easy to add such constraints, as described in the [reference](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/api-workflows/examples-and-walkthroughs).

The key concept in such a script is the [pagination](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/api-workflows/examples-and-walkthroughs). When you make a request to the API, you need to define where to start, and a number of items to fetch. Each response from the GET API will return the number of remaining items. In our example, we want to start at the last item of the previous call plus one.

packages to perform the request, handle JSON objects, and encode URLs

import requests

import json

import urllib

​

session = requests.Session()

​

API KEY as defined in the settings tab, so that the script has full access to the data

API_KEY = 'XXXX'

base endpoint, see [https://bubble.io/referencAPI.get_api.Endpoint](https://bubble.io/referencAPI.get_api.Endpoint)

base_url = '[https://yourapp.com/api/1.1/obj/invoice](https://yourapp.com/api/1.1/obj/invoice)'

​

Query initial parameters. We do not send a limit parameter (default is 100)

cursor = 0

params = {'cursor': cursor, 'api_token': API_KEY}

url = base_url + '?' + urllib.parse.urlencode(params)

response = session.get(url)

​

if response.status_code != 200:

print('Error with status code {}'.format(response.status_code))

exit()

​

chunk = response.json()['response']

remaining = chunk['remaining']

count = chunk['count']

results = chunk['results']

​

we print each object

for result in results:

print(json.dumps(result, indent=4, sort_keys=True))

​

cursor += count

​

print('No more entries')

Such a script can be used (and adapted) to save data instead of printing it, query some data that fits some constraints, etc.

 The API Connector

This section covers Bubble's API Connector. The API Connector is used to make outgoing connections to external applications and use it as a data source or trigger actions.

Help us improve this article

In the [Bubble API section](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api) we covered API requests that are incoming – they are initiated by an outside system and Bubble takes some kind of action based on their credentials, endpoint and parameters.

This is our in-depth manual article on the API Connector. If you are familiar with APIs and want the shorter technical reference go to the [API Connector reference entry](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-api-connector). We also have a dedicated article covering [API Connector security](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/security/api-security/api-connector-security).

In this section we’ll look at requests that are **outgoing** – when your Bubble app sends a request to an external system. When you use the API Connector, your Bubble app is the *client* and the API service is the *server*.

You can read more about the client/server relationship in our [Introduction to APIs](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/introduction-to-apis). Article section: [The client/server relationship](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/introduction-to-apiclient-and-server)​

![outgoing-api-call.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fa4uqiDqJuz4vjLjfPW5B%2Foutgoing-api-call.jpeg?alt=media&token=b715ebac-1632-4dc1-bbe9-e46597584246)

The API Connector handles calls that come ***from*** your Bubble app ***to*** another application.

​

By pointing the API Connector to different URLs (Universal Resource Locator) you can access specific resources that the API provider offers.

Just like incoming requests these calls can ask for some data to be returned or for an action to be performed.

Structurally, you’ll recognize what they look like: they also use an HTTP request that includes a method like GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE.

Bubble's plugin store offers thousands of plugins both made by Bubble and the community. Many plugins let you connect to well-known API services quickly and effortlessly without having to set it up in the API Connector. Link: [Plugin store](https://bubble.io/plugins) Article: [Plugins that connect to APIs](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/plugins-that-connect-to-apis)​

The API Connector

The API Connector is a special plugin built by Bubble's development team that lets you connect to any service that exposes a JSON-based, RESTful web API. You can use this to add API calls to fetch data from an external service, or post data to trigger some actions on the service's end.

[](https://youtu.be/nO8PSqeJaWk)

Our long-form video course gives you an introduction to how APIs work and how to use the API Connector.

**Installing the API Connector**

The API Connector is a plugin created by Bubble and needs to be installed in your application before it can be used.

To install the plugin:

- Navigate to the *Plugins* section of the Bubble editor and click *Add plugin*.
- Search for *API Connector*
- Click the *Install* button

![api-connector-plugin-install@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F1fdizjb0dOUpZWUwyefs%2Fapi-connector-plugin-install%402x.png?alt=media&token=fe200852-fb4f-4b4e-bb85-b2ae94b531c6)

Click the Install button to use the API Connector in your application.

**External API documentation**

Every API service is different and to make it possible to connect successfully to their platform, most providers offer API documentation. Using the external documentation is critical to understand how to authenticate and make calls to that specific service, so we recommend you get to know it before you start.

![stripe-documentation.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FLfIOXaYMOBmsmk5DcDP8%2Fstripe-documentation.png?alt=media&token=56c60a40-c75a-4d8c-b35e-5c0e8caf2a44)

API providers like Stripe offer detailed [documentation](https://stripe.com/docs) on how to set up API connections.

If this is your first time working with APIs, the documentation may seem fairly technical at first, but you’ll find that with the RESTful API style most providers follow a similar standard.

Most APIs will go through three steps before they can be used:

- First set up the **authentication** for the API service
- Secondly we set up the different **call**(s) we want to use
- Then we **initialize** the call to make sure it works and to see the server's response

Test accounts

Many API providers such as Stripe offer a demo account that you can use to test your API calls without making any actual changes (or payments in the case of Stripe). Check whether the service you want to connect to offers this kind of testing environment to be able to properly test all your calls with no risk.

**Naming API providers**

The first part of setting up a new API request is to give the service a name. This will typically be a descriptive name (often the same as the provider’s name) such as Stripe, Google Cloud and OpenWeatherAPI.

![api-name-bubble.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F5X3y6qxbwEigVt1mc4Jz%2Fapi-name-bubble.png?alt=media&token=e1933dc6-67df-4130-a7ca-db2708f2ee27)

Giving your API a descriptive name makes it easier to organize the different providers.

The name is used around the Bubble editor to organize the different calls that we’ll add later. It’s therefore a good idea to use a name that makes the relevant call easy to find later.

The API name becomes part of your application’s client-side code and should not contain any sensitive information.

**Authentication**

As we covered in our general guide on how APIs work, many API services will require authentication. This is the process of identifying **who** the client is in order to determine what resources it should have access to.

Authentication methods

There are many different ways to authenticate. Most API providers will have documentation available online that specifies their authentication method and many require you to generate a unique API token.

The list below represents the most common authentication types. You can read more about each type in the article below: Article: [Authenticating with the API Connector](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-api-connector/authentication)​

| Method                      | Description                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| None or self-handled        | No authentication required                                                    |
| Private key in URL          | The private key is included as a parameter in the URL                         |
| Private key in header       | The private key is included as an HTTP header in the request                  |
| HTTP Basic Auth             | The client sends username and password in plain text                          |
| OAuth2 Password Flow        | The client sends username and password and receives an access token in return |
| OAuth2 User-Agent Flow      | Similar to OAuth2 Password Flow, but for user-agents                          |
| OAuth2 Custom Token         | The client sends a custom token to the server for verification                |
| JSON Web Token (JWT)        | The client sends a JSON web token to the server for verification              |
| Client-side SSL certificate | The client presents a SSL certificate to the server for verification          |

**API tokens and security**

We recommend learning how to set up the API Connector in a secure way. If you want to learn more about this, check out our dedicated article on API Connector security.

Article: [API Connector security](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/security/api-security)​

If you are new to APIs it’s important to emphasize here the importance of keeping your API token **secret**. API tokens in principle serve the same function as a username and password, but they add security and flexibility that is useful to an API provider:

- They can be easily generated and revoked: Unlike a username and password, which are typically created and managed by an actual person, API tokens can be easily generated and revoked by the API provider. This makes it easy to control access to the API and limit the impact of any security breaches.
- They are more secure: API tokens are generally more secure than username and password combinations, because they are typically harder to guess or brute force. They can also be rotated regularly to further improve security.
- They are more convenient: API tokens are generally easier for developers to work with than username and password combinations, because they do not require any special handling. This can make it easier for developers to use your API and can increase adoption of your API.

Just like a username and password, a token is only as secure as the one who manages it. Tokens to important services like Stripe should be handled with the utmost confidentiality.

API keys/tokens should never be stored in Option Sets or in on-page elements and/or workflows, since that makes them visible in your application’s client-side source code.

Shared headers

Sometimes you'll need to add the same header to all your calls. This can be related to authentication, but it doesn't have to be. Another typical key and value included in the header section is the *content-type,* which specifies the expected format of the call.

Consult the external API documentation to see if they require any specific headers.

Shared parameters

Shared parameters, like the headers described above, will be added to each and every call in the relevant API. Shared parameters are added to the *body* of the request rather than the header.

It doesn't make any technical difference whether you add *headers* and *parameters* directly to each call or use the *Shared headers/parameters feature*. Adding them to this section will simply save you some time and make the headers and parameters easier to set up and manage.

**Adding calls**

Now that we have 1) given our API service a descriptive name and 2) authenticated as a client (if necessary) it’s time to add the actual calls.

![add-call-api-connector.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FbVIX65t8fVUgzIN6dJQ9%2Fadd-call-api-connector.png?alt=media&token=085ddf94-e3e4-4d1a-882c-690b3f7300e7)

To add a call, click the *Add another call* button

Again we need to name the call before doing anything else. Give it a descriptive name that can be combined with the name you gave earlier to the API provider. For example, you might name the API Provider Stripe and the API Call Create payment.

Secondly, we need to tell Bubble what this call will be used for in the Use as dropdown.

Use as

The *Use as* dropdown lets you select whether to use that particular API call as a data source or an action:

Data

Use as data means that Bubble will treat the API call as a data source. Use this for calls that you set up to retrieve data that you want to display in your app. You will find API data sources in the Get data from external API in the dropdown list of data sources.

![get-data-external-api@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FCQsQyzv6tRJN97osw0cB%2Fget-data-external-api%402x.png?alt=media&token=69a962e6-283e-4ac9-90aa-c03c4ad76be4)

Setting the API call to be of type **Data** allows you to use the call as a data source. That way you can use it to populate Repeating Group for example.

Action

Use as action makes the API call available as an action in your Workflow editor. You will find API action calls in the workflow editor under Plugins.

![run-api-call-as-action-bubbl@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FkROoSioQn77ihqEDSPRI%2Frun-api-call-as-action-bubbl%402x.png?alt=media&token=2c6d9a35-6e4f-4377-b574-3412d2c45bc3)

Setting an API call to type **Action** lets you run that call from a workflow in your application. The label (RentalSoftware - Create Unit) is a combination of the name you gave the API provider and the name of the call in the API Connector.

**The HTTP method**

When a call is made to a specific resource, we need to specify an HTTP method that tells the server what kind of action we want to initiate. The five most used HTTP methods are:

| **Action** | **Description** |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| GET        | Retrieve data   |
| POST       | Create data     |
| PUT        | Update data     |
| PATCH      | Replace data    |
| DELETE     | Delete data     |

HTTP methods are sometimes called *HTTP verbs*. Generally they are used as illustrated in the table above, but to find the correct HTTP method for the resource you want to access, check the API providers documentation.

![bubble-http-method.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FQX2wWdVVneNsxvrVgNsQ%2Fbubble-http-method.png?alt=media&token=9f69caf7-09b1-4a14-885f-4db189a1f6d9)

Setting the HTTP method in the dropdown in red tells the external app what kind of action you want to take. GET usually means you want to return data.

**The URL and endpoint**

In our [general article on APIs](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/introduction-to-apis) we explored how a RESTful API call uses a URL to identify a specific resource.

For example, when we were looking at Bubble’s Data API (used to give external systems access to the database) and Workflow API (used to give external systems access to workflows) we looked at how Bubble generates a unique URL for each data type you choose to expose in the Data API and each API Workflow you choose to expose in the backend workflow editor.

External RESTful APIs work in the same way: you direct your Bubble application to a specific URL in order to reach the resource that you want. Together, the HTTP method and the endpoint form a unique API endpoint that defines the specific action that is being requested.

For example, a GET request to a "/users" endpoint might be used to retrieve a list of users from an API, while a POST request to the "/users" endpoint might be used to create a new user.

![api-endpoint@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F5Y49MTVcEAjDZ7RMc9pI%2Fapi-endpoint%402x.png?alt=media&token=2da6d871-c819-4d84-85d5-d52d0acf13b8)

In the example above, we have found the correct endpoint to translate a text using the Google Cloud Translation API. The documentation also

Finding the correct endpoint

The endpoint is the combination of the HTTP method and the URL (resource locator). What method to use and what the URL is differs between different API services, and you can usually find the correct endpoint by consulting the documentation of the API provider.

Case: Setting up Google Translate in the API Connector

----
 Authentication

This section covers the different authentication methods the API Connector offers.

Help us improve this article

**Authentication** is the process of identifying **who** a client is in order to determine what resources they have access to on the server.

Authentication

The first part of connecting to an external API is to authenticate (unless you are connecting to a public API that doesn't require authentication).

This can in many ways be compared to logging into a an app – by providing a username and password you authenticate with that app and the app can proceed to determine what kind of resources you should be given access to.

![api-connector-authentication.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FeaE2dZAJv6zBZkdUDIVO%2Fapi-connector-authentication.jpeg?alt=media&token=6bccee8c-0bf4-47fa-b550-c94638b186ff)

Before granting access to a resource, many API providers will require that you authenticate

An API call works in the same way in principle: by providing some authentication you are letting the server know **who** you are so that it can respond with the appropriate data. As we explored in our article on [what RESTful APIs are](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/introduction-to-apis/what-is-a-restful-api), each and every API call are completely independent of each other – in other words, you must authenticate for *every* call that you make. The server does not "remember" who you are, but verifies the identity of every client who makes a request.

This is why we first need to add the authentication to any API provider in the API Connector; this way Bubble can automatically send the correct authentication along with every call, so that you only need to set it once.

API Keys

Many APIs use what's called an *API key*. This is a securely generated token that serves as both a username and a password.

API keys are considered sensitive data and should never be shared with anyone. Treat it like you would a username and password. Do not store API keys in Option Sets, page elements or on-page workflows as they will become visible in the client-side code of your application. If you suspect that someone has access to one of your API keys, most API providers will let you generate a new one.

API key security in the API Connector

API keys that you add to the correct fields in the API Connector are not visible to your app's Users or other Bubble users. They are stored in an encrypted state on Bubble's server.

API calls from the API Connector are routed through Bubble's server, which means that all the authentication methods below offer the same level of added security. RESTful API calls are sent via the HTTP protocol, which in modern web systems is encrypted with HTTPS during transit.

Development keys and live keys

Many API providers allow you to generate to sets of keys: one for testing and one for the live version of your app (often called *production*).

![development-key-api-connector.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FtBnNPm4wlWzsCWxQ1hnL%2Fdevelopment-key-api-connector.png?alt=media&token=5c0b8f4b-de90-420c-8ab2-e8fe7983449b)

Bubble lets you store two keys – one for testing and one for the live app.

It's best practice to use these keys as intended: Bubble lets you add each of the keys to the development and live version of your app and will automatically use the correct key depending on which version you are running.

Designing the calls starts with the authentication method, which will sign the calls in Run-mode. Authentication can be done in several, standard, ways. Note that whenever you're building an API connection with some keys, you will need to enter some actual keys to test. These keys are only saved to help you work on your plugin. They will never get sent to users that use your plugins. Instead, they will have to enter their own API keys in the Plugins tab of the editor.

In this article we use multiple fairly technical terms to explain how the different authentication methods work. You may find our [API Glossary](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/api-glossary) useful if there are words or terms you're unfamiliar with. If you are new to API's you may also find our [Introduction to APIs](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/introduction-to-apis) and [What are RESTful APIs](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/introduction-to-apis/what-is-a-restful-api) articles useful.

Authentication methods

There are many different ways to authenticate, and which method to use is specified by the API provider in their documentation. Below we will go over the different methods that Bubble supports, which cover most RESTful API providers.

The different authentication methods are visislbe in the dropdown next to the API name:

![authentication-methods-api-connector.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FAEl6S9UuofXGnGYaIg7R%2Fauthentication-methods-api-connector.png?alt=media&token=dad03cac-2b93-476e-ac4b-c57a8d90d863)

None or self-handled

Some providers require no authentication. This can also be the case if you are connecting two systems that you both control. By selecting this option Bubble will not send any authentication with the call.

You can also handle authentication with custom parameters and handlers but this should be done with caution.

We do not recommend handling authentication yourself as this comes with a risk of exposing your API keys and the connection. Bubble's built-in authentication system is designed to keep your data and connections secure.

​

Private key in URL

The *Private key in URL* option lets you add the key in the URL of each call.

- The first field is the **name** of the **key**, which specifies how the authorization parameter key should be named in the URL. You will need to check the API provider's documentation for how they want the key to be named
- The second is the actual API key for the **live** version of your app
- The third is the API key for the **development** version of your app

![key-in-url.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FPe6tOfjFMmZ9HOFAkGUT%2Fkey-in-url.png?alt=media&token=23f75510-fa75-41d7-a0cd-3a82d5855595)

What does a private key in the header look like?

With this information, Bubble will add a parameter to the URL of each call, like the example below:

GET [https://myapp.bubbleapps.io/version-test/api/1.1/obj/datatype/UID?private-key=this-is-the-live-key](https://myapp.bubbleapps.io/version-test/api/1.1/obj/datatype/UID?private-key=this-is-the-live-key)

In this example we are using the GET method to get information about a specific data type in a Bubble app..

Private key in header

With this method, the key is added to the header of all requests. Most providers name the parameter *Authorization*, but you can give the parameter a custom name as specified in the external API documentation if needed.

![key-in-header.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F2jKVrSFvrvlJlJpIkGOj%2Fkey-in-header.png?alt=media&token=38978585-3708-41c2-903b-4a4814bb2e40)

- The first is the name of the parameter the server expects. Check the external API documentation for this.
- The third is the API key for the **live** version of your app
- The second is the actual API key for the **development** version of your app

What does a private key in the header look like?

Authorization: Bearer

The example above would be one *row* of the header – it also contains other data. The __ is replaced by the actual token without the <> signs_._

The actual key name in the example above can look different depending on the API provider. Consult their documentation to find the right formatting for their particular setup.

HTTP Basic Auth

The HTTP Basic Auth method is a bit different than the two previous in that it works by sending the client's username and password in the header of the request. The username and password is often encoded using Base64.

A username/password will be sent with each request, according to the HTTP Basic Auth protocol (see [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)).

![http-basic-auth.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F2dXhL6HhPC6dysbHB7pL%2Fhttp-basic-auth.png?alt=media&token=f6a04148-ad1e-44b0-8b7f-74e7868c9962)

What does HTTP Basic auth look like in the header?

The HTTP Basic auth method looks a lot like the private key in header method:

Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=

The "dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=" string is an encoded version of the string "username:password".

​

Oauth2 Password Flow

In the Oauth2 Password Flow method you send a username and password to the external app, and the app authenticates using those credentials. The external server generates a token that can be used for subsequent requests until it expires or is revoked (at which point Bubble will renew it for you).

Your app needs to call a specific endpoint to get the returned token, and you need to consult the external documentation to determine what the URL of this endpoint is.

You can read more about the mechanics of this authentication type in the [OAuthLib documentation](https://oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2/grants/password.html).

How secure is this method?

From a technical perspective it's safe to send a username and password via an encrypted HTTPS request. Still, this method should be used with some caution since any time you share a username and password with a third party you are opening up to potential misuse and must place your trust in that third party to maintain their security in the exchange.

![password-flow.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FZJKWSVmAXSD15PH3toWE%2Fpassword-flow.png?alt=media&token=59d7827b-d392-4cdf-96b7-3663cc0b3da3)

Oauth2 Custom Token

This flow is similar to the *Oauth2 Password Flow* but offers more customization in case the API provider is not following the common standard in the method above. The token will be added to calls as a Bearer Token and will automatically be renewed when necessary.

Note that to function, the token should be returned as an object with two keys (at least), `access_token` and `expires_in` .

Oauth2 User-Agent Flow

Setting up the Oauth2 User-Agent Flow can be a bit complicated if you are not familiar with APIs. There are many plugins that can set up the connection for you without having to go through the API Connector. Article: [Finding API-related plugins](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/plugins-that-connect-to-apis)​

The Oauth2 User-Agent Flow is the most widely used to to connect when you use the API on behalf of the User (meaning that the User is logging in using their own account to the third-party service, such as their Facebook or LinkedIn profile). This method takes a few more steps than the previous ones, as you will in practice need to authenticate with two accounts:

- First, you connect to the external app using credentials that the app has generated for you.
- Then, the User authenticates themselves with their own credentials on a page hosted by the external app and authorizes that your app is given access. Oftentimes they will already be logged in and simply need to authorize the request.
- The API Connector then makes a call to a specific endpoint to the newly generated token that provides access to subsequent calls
- Finally, the API Connector connects to another endpoint using the token to authenticate and getting access to the User's profile information (such as email, profile photo, etc). The information available depends on the service and sometimes the personal settings of the User in the third-party system.

Terms used in the external Oauth2 API documentation

Scope

The Scope setting determines the level of permissions you are asking for from the external server. Scope settings and how they are specified can vary from provider to provider, so the entries in the list below should be considered examples to illustrate what the scope setting is for:

| **Scope example**  | **Description**                                                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| admin              | Full administrative access to make changes to a User's resources                        |
| email              | Access to the User's email address.                                                     |
| profile            | Access to the User's basic profile information such as name, email and profile picture. |
| read or readonly   | Permission to read but not modify a user's resources.                                   |
| write or readwrite | Permission to read and modify a user's resources.                                       |

Scope parameters are usually separated by a space as in the example below:

readonly email

Accessing a third-party User profile often means accessing that User's personal information. To respect the User's privacy and minimize the risk of personal data being misused or mishandled, it's important to only request the minimum level of access necessary for your app to work.

Your app's credentials

As we explored above, the Oauth2 User-Agent Flow involves first authenticating your app as the client making the request. While these settings can vary depending on the API provider, the most widely used method is to provide two keys for authentication:

| **Key**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                   | **Text**                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Client ID     | This string identifies **who** you are (as the client), which lets the server proceed in determining what you should be given access to.          | The client ID is not considered sensitive data.                                            |
| Client secret | This string is used to cryptographically sign the token request and prove that the request is authentic (since only your app would have that key) | The client secret key should be kept secret and should not be shared or exposed in any way |

Using App ID and App Secret together provides a secure way for the API provider to identify the client (your app) and ensure that it is who it claims to be – all without exposing the two keys to your app's Users.

The two keys are usually generated in the settings of the API provider.

![spotify-api-example.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FgqziB4aCfjXXtHvbTEW6%2Fspotify-api-example.png?alt=media&token=06fbf567-c67f-447b-874a-a2c48d5829c6)

This is what an OAuth2 connection to a Spotify user profile might look like.

​

JSON Web Token

Some services use this more advanced [protocol](https://jwt.io/) to handle scope and permissions. This is usually for enterprise-type services, like Box or Google Cloud.

To authenticate with a service using the JSON Web Token method, you need:

- The email that's used to set up the account with the third party
- The endpoint that returns the token (which you'll find in the external API documentation)
- The private RSA key that the service has provided

The private key needs to be formatted as the below example, including the '-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----' and '-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----':

\-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

................................................................

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

\-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

Client-side SSL certificate

Using a Client-side SSL certificate is not as widely used as some of the other methods, but it's sometimes used in internal enterprise networks.

A client-side SSL certificate servers as a digital certificate that your app can you to authenticate with the server. It consists of two parts: The **Certificate file content** is the data contained in a digital certificate file (also known as a **public** key certificate). It contains information about the identity of the certificate holder (your app), such as a name and public key. It also holds information about the certificate issuer (the server you are connecting to), such as its name and digital signature.

The **Key file content** is the data contained in a **private** key file. It's used in conjunction with the public keys of both parties to encrypt and decrypt information.

 API Connector security

This section covers security related to the API Connector plugin.

This article covers the **security** aspects of using the API Connector plugin specifically. If you want to learn more about the API Connector in general, you can check out the articles below:

Article: [The API Connector](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-api-connector) Article series: [API](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api)​

The API Connector is Bubble-made plugin used to make outbound API calls to external apps and systems. The API Connector is designed to automatically manage many security aspects and defaults to strict security settings to prevent unintentional vulnerabilities.

Still, as with any other area of app development, it's essential for you, the app developer, to ensure the API connector is configured securely and to familiarize yourself with best practices in this domain.

Handling API keys

In this section, when we say "API keys," we're talking about all generated tokens used for authentication. This includes not just traditional API keys, but also OAuth tokens, JWTs (JSON Web Tokens), secret access codes, and other authentication credentials.

Many services that you connect to using the API connector will generate one or more API keys that you use to authenticate your requests.

![authentication-bubble.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FRuxi0Oh5kFl4JzgmVGEY%2Fauthentication-bubble.jpeg?alt=media&token=2108a28a-f76c-42aa-87f8-6c0018441c88)

Authentication identifies **who** the client is and authorization determines **what** they should have access to.

API keys are unique strings of letters and numbers that act like a password or a digital handshake between applications. They grant access to specific functionalities and data within an API service, allowing your app to talk to that system seamlessly.

> Just as you wouldn't want to leave your home key under a doormat for anyone to find, it's crucial to keep your API keys hidden and secure.
If they are exposed, malicious actors can misuse them, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or unexpected charges if the API has associated costs.
By ensuring API keys remain private, you're safeguarding the relevant API connection.
Some ground rules for handling API keys in Bubble:

**API keys should never be stored in places that can be revealed in your app's source code, such as:**

❌ Option sets ❌ In on-page workflows, elements and dynamic expressions ❌ In app texts (translation strings) ❌ In custom states ❌ In URL parameters ❌ In the names and/or labels of your workflows, elements, pages, data types/fields and option sets ❌ In the default values of your data type fields

**API keys should not be shared with anyone outside of your team - do not share it in places such as:**

❌ Chat channels ❌ Forum posts ❌ Social media posts ❌ Screenshots

API keys should be handled like you would handle the passwords of your most important logins.

Parameters

**What are parameters?**

Parameters in an API call are essentially pieces of information you send along with the call to either request specific data or provide some context. If the recipient recognizes the parameters, they can then tailor the response to fit your requirements. For example, if you're calling an API to get weather information, a parameter might be the city or postal code. If you are calling an API to create a new user in an external app, parameters might be the email address and name of that user.

**Where are parameters included?**

Parameters can be placed in various parts of an API call:

- **URL Parameters**: Often seen in the URL itself after a "?" symbol. For example, `api.website.com/data?city=NewYork`.
- **Header Parameters**: Included in the request header, often used for authentication or specifying content type.
- **Body Parameters**: Used in POST requests, where data is sent in the request body. Useful for sending more complex data like JSON objects.

**Why set them to private in the API Connector?**

In the API Connector, setting parameters to "private" removes it from your app's code files and makes it inaccessible to end-users. This is possible because API calls by default are routed through Bubble's server. This allows us to store the parameter only on the server and include it as needed when the call is made.

![private-parameter@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FWs9qD9HAVqvplNMsSgcg%2Fprivate-parameter%402x.png?alt=media&token=00f756f7-483d-4a77-bfb6-f1fb887eca26)

By checking the *Private* box, we make sure that the parameter is kept hidden away on the server, invisible to your end-users. When the call is made, the parameter is sent from Bubble's server to the API service.

This is particularly important for sensitive info. For example, you wouldn't want to accidentally expose an API key or confidential data. Keeping parameters private ensures they remain a secret between your app and the API.

Making URL parameters private

In the example above, we've ensured that a parameter in the *Header* is private. But what about parameters that you include in the URL? Just like header and body parameters, they too can be set to private. But before that, they need to be parameterized.

Let's first look at an **insecure** parameter included in the URL:

![insecure-api-call@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FSy8qFrKBFw5HogIkOITy%2Finsecure-api-call%402x.png?alt=media&token=02e5335f-7755-4b6d-8b3e-ee6a38f0f284)

The information above would be visible in your app's code file on the user's device. In many cases there is nothing wrong with this, but in the example above, we have included some sensitive information: an API [key.So](http://key.So) how do we hide it?

Note the text on the right-hand side of the URL input form that says *(use [] for params)*. This tells us that we can use brackets to turn a string of text in the URL into a parameter, that can then be set to *private.* Let's see what a more **secure** way to send the parameter would look like:

![parameterize-url-parameter@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FliwxU6CfVUXMPBxoFvZT%2Fparameterize-url-parameter%402x.png?alt=media&token=db0ff037-9516-4a08-8f08-68063f5d2296)

In the example above, we wrapped the URL parameter inside of brackets, and Bubble automatically creates a parameter below with an input field for both the key and the value. This allows us to set the parameter to *private* keeping it hidden from the app's users.

You can set up more than one bracket in each URL, and even turn the whole URL into a private parameter if you prefer to even keep that hidden.

API call structure and security

This section gives a brief introduction to how API calls work. If you want to learn more about how API requests and responses are structured, as well as the HTTP protocol, you may be interested in reading our extended section on how APIs work.

Article series: [Introduction to APIs](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/introduction-to-apis)​

Article: [What is a RESTful API?](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/introduction-to-apis/what-is-a-restful-api)​

Article section: [What is the HTTP protocol?](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/introduction-to-apis/what-is-a-restful-apwhat-is-the-http-protocol)​

An API call happens in two stages: there's the **request** and the **response.** In the case of the API Connector (making *outbound* calls), your Bubble app (the **client**) is always the one making the request, and the server you are communicating with (the **server**) is sending the response. The entire process is transferred via the HTTP protocol (and in most cases encrypted with SSL/TLS), just like when you load a web page.

To learn more about the different *parts* of a request, we recommend the article listed above. In the table below, we've listed the short-form explanation for each, along with common security recommendations:

| **Part**     | **Purpose**                                         | **Security Considerations**                                       | **Recommendations**                                                                                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ​Header​     | Contains *metadata* for the API call                | Can reveal information about the request, e.g., content type​     | Avoid sensitive info in custom headers                                                                   |
| ​Body​       | Contains the main *content* of the request/response | Transmits the actual data, which can be sensitive                 | Avoid including information that the API server doesn't need.                                            |
| ​Method​     | Indicates the *type* of request (e.g., GET, POST)   | Certain methods (e.g., POST, PUT) may change data on the server   | Use the appropriate method for the task; Avoid using methods that change data unless necessary           |
| ​URL​        | Specifies the endpoint and sometimes parameters     | Parameters can expose sensitive information if not set to private | Use the *private* setting to mark parameters as private Avoid placing sensitive info directly in the URL |
| ​Parameters​ | Details for specific queries or actions             | Can be crucial for data operations                                | Make sure parameters don't leak sensitive data Use *private* when necessary                              |

Don't send the server more data than is needed

Keep in mind that while the information in a call may be encrypted with TLS while in transit, the receiver of the request (the server) will decrypt all the data included in it. While most API services can be trusted to handle that information securely, it's still best practice to not include more information than is needed. That's why our recommendations above encourage you to follow that practice.

This is in line with the principle of least privilege.

Default parameter values

To enable a specific API call, you need to initialize it. If the call includes parameters, you need to assign a default value to these parameters that Bubble can use when the initialization is done. The default parameters become part of your app's code base, and can be viewed on the device of the user.

- Do not store sensitive information in this field
- If you prefer the value to not show up anywhere, you can delete its content after the initialization is done

![initialize-call-parameters@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FEtmdBs8ouE4r1ndGCMgV%2Finitialize-call-parameters%402x.png?alt=media&token=80cd2c3d-1bd6-4a72-91f8-5ebc81283db3)

Sometimes you'll need to include one or more parameters when you initialize a call. You can remove these values after it has been initalized to avoid them being visible anywhere in your app's code.

External API dashboard settings and features

When using the API Connector, many of the settings you will use with that API are not set on Bubble's side, but in the dashboard of the API provider. To maintain secure connections, it's important to go over these settings and ensure they are properly set up. Settings are sometimes connected to one specific API key, meaning that you can use different keys with different settings to maintain flexible security.

Note that the different settings and features available in each API service can vary.

Limit Permissions

Many API services offer settings for limiting the permissions of a call, such as which applications can use the key or which API services the key can call. We recommend setting permissions to the strictest possible setting that lets you successfully run the call you need.

**Rate Limits**

Many providers have rate limits, or allow you to set your own rate limits in order to maintain an expected volume of calls or stay within a budget. Learn how to set and view rate limits set by the API you're connecting to. This prevents overwhelming the server, overspending your budget and potential IP blacklisting.

Get to know audit logs and analytics

Many API services keep detailed logs of every request and response that goes through their platform using your authentication. Learning to use the audit logs helps you stay on top of all the data that is exchanged, as well as debugging errors. Logs and analytics can also help you identify unusual patterns that might indicate malicious activity or potential vulnerabilities.

FAQ: API Connector

What should I do if I misplace an API token?

If an API token somehow ends up in the wrong place, we strongly recommend immediately logging into the relevant API service and disabling it. With most services you can then generate a new one, making the old API key useless.

 Data API security

This section covers security related to the Data API.

This article covers the **security** aspects of using the Bubble Data API specifically. If you want to learn more about the Bubble Data API in general, you can check out the articles below:

Article: [The Data API](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-data-api) Article series: [The Bubble API](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api)​

The Data API allows external apps and systems to interact programmatically with the data stored in your Bubble app. It provides a set of endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

Naturally, giving an external system access to your app's database can open up for potential vulnerabilities, and it's important to learn how to use it correctly.

Guiding principles in Data API security

The principle of least privilege

As we've explored multiple times in our Security article series, the principle of least privilege also applies strongly to the Data API. We'll now go over how you can plan and execute to adhere to this principle when you set up the Data API.

> In a bank, not every employee has the keys to the vault. A teller can access the cash drawer but doesn't have the authority to authorize large wire transfers. Conversely, the bank manager might have that authority but doesn't necessarily need access to every single safety deposit box.

Authentication and authorization

In our Introduction to APIs article we explored the two sibling concepts of *authentication* and *authorization.*

![authentication-bubble.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FRuxi0Oh5kFl4JzgmVGEY%2Fauthentication-bubble.jpeg?alt=media&token=2108a28a-f76c-42aa-87f8-6c0018441c88)

Authentication identifies **who** the client is and authorization determines **what** they should have access to.

The way this logic is structured is no different than in real life: before you let someone in through your front door, you would want to know who it is. In that way, they *authenticate* (you recognize their face), and this allows you to *authorize* what they have access to (step into your house).

The same pattern of identification and authorization is applied in countless real-life scenarios:

- Airports: (who is the passenger? What plane do they have access to)
- Cinemas: (does the person have a ticket? To what movie?)
- Banks (who is the customer? What bank accounts do they have access to)

The reason for highlighting this in real-life scenarios is to emphasize the authentication/authorization way of thinking to your security planning. When you are planning security for your Data API, you can ask the question in exactly the same way:

- *Who* is the client trying to access my app's database?
- *What* should this client have access to?

When you combine this way of thinking with the principle of least knowledge, we have some very helpful rules of thumbs to guide your thinking:

- *Who is the client trying to access my app's database?*
   - *I need to know in order to apply the principle of least knowledge*
- *What* should this client have access to?
   - According to the principle of least knowledge – only as much as they need and not an inch more

Having established those principles, let's look at what that means in practice as you develop your app.

Authentication

The first step in any secure transaction is that of knowing who the client is. For the Data API, this follows a range that we can split into three categories:

- No one has access (the Data API is disabled)
- Some clients have access (the Data API is enabled, but requires authentication)
- Everyone has access (the Data API is enabled, and requires no authentication)

No one has access

Before you make any decisions regarding your app's Data API, you need to determine whether anyone should have access at all. The Data API is disabled by default, but can be enabled in the *Settings* – *API* section of your app by checking *Enable Data API*.

![activate-data-api.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FvYr0YmnkuI8Wfm1iWTwa%2Factivate-data-api.png?alt=media&token=02543942-91ef-46d2-9146-059c70891fb7)

If your app doesn't need any external app or system to access the database, you can safely keep that checkbox unchecked. This keeps the Data API completely disconnected and no other security measures are needed.

Some clients have access

The second level in our access range is to give one or more clients access, but not everyone. This is where most apps with an enabled Data API will be, and it means we need to authenticate ("check the ID") of every system that wants access to the database.

There are two ways to authenticate an external app or system without giving everyone access. To learn how to set up each one, following the article link listed below:

- **Authenticating as a user** essentially means to "log in" to your app in the same way as a regular user would. This means that you can apply Privacy Rules to control what that user has access to. This is an access level that gives you a high degree of control over what that user can and can't do in your database. Article: [The Data API - authenticating as a user](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/authentication/as-a-user) Using this authentication method, you will usually continue to set up rules for who can access what. Or in other words, authorization. Follow this link to continue setting that up.
- **Authenticating as an admin** means to use Bubble's built-in API token system to give access. This automatically gives them full administrator access, which means the same access level as you have as the app's developer (not to be confused with any admin role you set up in your app). This access level grants extensive permissions, allowing the reading, modification, and deletion of all data in your app. Ensure it's used only with external apps or systems you trust implicitly. Article: [The Data API - authenticating as an admin](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/authentication/as-an-admin)​

Everyone has access

In this option, we disregard the authentication step altogether: the door is open and anyone can walk in. The logic then follows that since we're not checking *who* walks through the door, we can't determine what each visitor should have access to. Everyone is treated the same.

This method should only be used when you are determined to give free, public access to your database. Keep in mind this can not only affect your security, but also the amount of workload that your app consumes (as API requests will spend server resources, adding to your total workload).

To learn how to set up your Data API to offer everyone access, see the article below: Article: [The Data API - no authentication](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/authentication/no-authentication)​

Authorization

Returning to the bank metaphor: a person who registers as a customer in a bank needs to have access to their own account, but most would find it strange if they were given access to *all* accounts. The same logic applies to an app where you don't want to share *all* data even to people that are authenticated to use the app in the first place.

We've taken care of the authentication (who is the client), and now it's time to explore how we determine the *authorization* for those client (what the client can access). This is done in two ways:

Enabling data types

The first step to protect data is to enable only the data types that you want to expose.

Keep in mind the following:

- Unchecked data types are **not** available in the Data API regardless of how the user authenticates
- Checked data types are exposed, but adhere to the privacy rules in combination with the client’s authentication. We'll look at data types in the next step.

![activate-data-api.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FvYr0YmnkuI8Wfm1iWTwa%2Factivate-data-api.png?alt=media&token=02543942-91ef-46d2-9146-059c70891fb7)

When you enable the Data API, you will see the list of of data types that you want to show.

![expose-data-types@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FT2RAtsjjXzaIgvYdqczf%2Fexpose-data-types%402x.png?alt=media&token=a53ceb0c-199e-455b-a9c1-7f4bd9ae14b9)

Click the image to see a larger version.

The data types that are *not* enabled (unchecked) will not be accessible by anyone. In the example above, we have a data type *Product* that we want to share with another app. Following the principle of least privilege, we'll *only* activate that one, and keep all other data types unchecked.

This setting takes care of the overarching authorization: what data types any client has access to. In the next step we'll look at privacy rules: they provide the fine-grained control

Privacy rules

After enabling the data types we want to expose, it's usually a good idea to use privacy rules to control *which fields* on those data types can be accessed, and *what kind of actions* can be performed.

Just like in your regular app, privacy rules are set up on a user-basis. In other words, which user you authenticate determines the level of access they have to:

- Find in searches
   - What fields and uploaded files to expose
- Make changes to
   - Create
   - Edit
   - Delete

Data API security checklist

With the methods above in mind, let's go over the tools that secure your Data API.

- **Keep the principle of least access in mind** ([link](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/security/api-security/data-api-securitthe-principle-of-least-privilege))
- **Decide who has access (authentication)** First, decide who has access to the data API:
   - No one ([link](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/security/api-security/data-api-securitno-one-has-access))
   - Selected clients ([link](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/security/api-security/data-api-securitsome-systems-have-access))
   - All clients ([link](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/security/api-security/data-api-securiteveryone-has-access))
- **Decide what they have access to (authorization)**
   - Enable only the data types you want to expose ([link](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/security/api-security/data-api-securitenabling-data-types))
   - Use privacy rules for fine-grained control over fields and editing rights ([link](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/security/api-security/data-api-securitprivacy-rules))

 Workflow API security

This section covers security related to the Workflow API.

This article covers the **security** aspects of using the Bubble Workflow API specifically. If you want to learn more about the Bubble Workflow API in general, you can check out the articles below:

Article: [The Workflow API](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api) Article series: [The Bubble API](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api)​

The Workflow API allows external apps and systems to trigger specific workflows within your Bubble app. It provides a set of endpoints to initiate predefined sequences of actions or events in your app from outside sources. Naturally, opening up for external systems to activate workflows in your app can introduce potential vulnerabilities, so it's essential to learn how to use it correctly.

In this article, we'll explore how to set up API workflows that are secure.

Guiding principles in Workflow API security

The principle of least privilege

As discussed in various sections of our Security article series, the principle of least privilege remains important when working with the Workflow API. In this segment, we'll delve into methods and strategies to ensure adherence to this principle when setting up workflows that can be reached from outside of your own app.

> In a bank, not every employee has the keys to the vault. A teller can access the cash drawer but doesn't have the authority to authorize large wire transfers. Conversely, the bank manager might have that authority but doesn't necessarily need access to every single safety deposit box.

Authentication and authorization

If you are reading this article series in order, you'll remember that we've talked extensively about authentication and authorization.

![authentication-bubble.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FRuxi0Oh5kFl4JzgmVGEY%2Fauthentication-bubble.jpeg?alt=media&token=2108a28a-f76c-42aa-87f8-6c0018441c88)

Authentication identifies **who** the client is and authorization determines **what** they should have access to.

With the Data API, we explored how the **what** is basically the database; the data types, fields and operations that a specific user can access. The Workflow API is essentially the same, except that instead of protecting data, we're protecting workflows.

We'll still use the same mindset when planning our security: every client that wants to trigger workflows in your app need to go through the two steps of determining **who** they are, and **what** they have access to.

Authentication

When an API workflow is created, Bubble automatically generates a unique endpoint to trigger it, such as:

[https://my-bubble-application.bubbleapps.io/version-test/api/1.1/wf/my-workflow](https://my-bubble-application.bubbleapps.io/version-test/api/1.1/wf/my-workflow)

If the workflow required no authentication, knowing this URL would be enough for any actor (malicious or not) to trigger the workflow as many times as they want. Let's first talk about a few different reasons why you should be careful with that approach:

- Running an API workflow spends server resource, just like other workflows in your app
   - If an API is repeatedly triggered, it can increase your workload consumption
   - If left completely unchecked and continuously running, the Bubble has safeguards in place to ensure your app doesn't spend too much server resources: this can lead to your app slowing down or even stopping completely
- Running API workflows can potentially make a lot of changes in your database – by requiring authentication, you are adding one more potential safeguard on top of privacy rules and conditions in that workflow (we'll get back to this point later in the article)

While you are free to set up your API workflows as you see fit, we generally recommend that you always require authentication to run it.

Just like with the Data API, the access level of an API workflow can be split into three categories:

- No clients have access to any API workflows (the Workflow API is disabled or all API workflows are unexposed)
- Some clients have access to selected API workflows (the Workflow API is enabled, but requires authentication)
- Everyone has access (the Workflow API is enabled, and no API workflows require authentication)

No one has access

The first scenario is that no client, whatever their credentials, have access to any API workflows at all. There are two ways to do this:

Disabling the Workflow API

The first way is to disable the Workflow API altogether under *Settings - API*.

![disable-workflow-api@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FQk7ycXOtk7YGhWF3BaZE%2Fdisable-workflow-api%402x.png?alt=media&token=17c9c3a3-2cac-49d2-8a4e-f1fe5c10a8e9)

This ensures that you don't have any Workflow API endpoints exposed at all, and nothing can be triggered from outside of your app. However, this also means that Bubble's backend editor will be disabled altogether, meaning that you cannot set up any internal API Workflows.

Disabling individual workflows

The second option is to keep the Workflow API enabled, but set every API Workflow that you create to be non-exposed. This means that the API workflow can be triggered internally in your app, but it will not have any endpoint that can be triggered from the outside.

![unexpose-api-workflow@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FPKNCUHv5Kun7O0Z809nl%2Funexpose-api-workflow%402x.png?alt=media&token=9f67c8d2-580d-4a46-b682-65f1732783a0)

Using the *Expose as a public API workflow* setting allows you to cut an individual API workflow off from external apps and systems.

Using this method gives you access to the backend editor and all of its features, but requires that you are careful with the settings on each individual API workflow.

Some clients have access to selected API workflows

The second option is to require authentication and open up for selected API Workflows to be triggered from outside of your own app.

Authentication

Authenticating clients to give them access to API workflows can be done in a few different ways. We go over this in detail in the article below:

Article: [The Bubble API: Authentication methods](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/authentication)​

Exposing selected API workflows

Having set up the authentication, we can then proceed to set up which API workflows we want to expose.

API workflows are set to be exposed automatically when created – keep in mind that in this step you are *disabling* those you don't want to expose, and not the other way around.

To disable API workflows that you don't want exposed, uncheck the *Expose as a public API workflow* setting. This removes the endpoint of that workflow entirely, making it impossible to trigger regardless of authentication.

![unexpose-api-workflow@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FPKNCUHv5Kun7O0Z809nl%2Funexpose-api-workflow%402x.png?alt=media&token=9f67c8d2-580d-4a46-b682-65f1732783a0)

Using the *Expose as a public API workflow* setting allows you to cut an individual API workflow off from external apps and systems.

This way, only selected clients can run API workflows, and only selected workflows can be executed regardless of who the client is.

Everyone has access

The final option is to open up API workflows to be triggered by anyone, without having to authenticate at all. Generally, we don't recommend this, as this opens up for potential misuse.

![open-access-api-workflow@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FPPvRx9PDrhXmi07wLPR9%2Fopen-access-api-workflow%402x.png?alt=media&token=3d057c87-f644-4078-93ab-226dc93c545e)

To open up API workflows to be triggered without any authentication, check the two boxes as illustrated above. Optionally, you can check the last box (*Ignore privacy rules when running the workflow)* to give the broadest possible access to your data as well.

Authorization

With the Data API, authorization is generally linked to data – what a client can see and make changes to. With the Workflow API, the picture becomes slightly more complex: since we are dealing with workflows, there are two more ways you can fine-tune your authorization for each individual client:

- ​**Data** (which can be protected with privacy rules)
- ​**Conditions** (which can set further restrictions on the workflow or individual action steps inside that workflow)

![api-workflow-authorization.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FA9pUjRYd31YwG5xvX3fE%2Fapi-workflow-authorization.jpeg?alt=media&token=f5c68e1f-3b26-4026-8d08-2f2ce41de842)

An API workflow can go through multiple steps of authorization as illustrated above. Click the image to enlarge.

In the schematic illustration above, we can see the potential route a Workflow API request could take in terms of authorization.

First, Bubble determines who the client is (authentication), and then proceeds to check whether the client is allowed to run the workflow at all (Authorization 1). Then, the flow can potentially introduce two more authorization steps (illustrated as Authorization 2): a *condition* could stop the client from running the whole workflow or one or more of its actions, and *privacy rules* could limit the client's access to *find* data to make changes to.

Let's look at how this could look in the editor:

![conditional-expression-api-workflow@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FcRoYDasBcQlwqFBFKNNt%2Fconditional-expression-api-workflow%402x.png?alt=media&token=afb69716-1a21-424e-9836-8ee068711c8f)

Click the image to enlarge.

- The API workflow may require authentication/authorization to run
- The *List of things to change* may produce a limited result because privacy rules protect some or all records from being found in a search
- The *Only when* conditional expression may prohibit the client from running the workflow, even if they are authenticated.

Data (privacy rules)

If you are unfamiliar with privacy rules, we highly recommend reading the articles below to get an understanding of how they work.

Article: [Privacy rules](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/protecting-data-with-privacy-rules) Article: [Workflow API privacy rules](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/workflow-api-privacy-rules)​

After having set up the authentication method you want to use, you then need to authorize those clients to access data *within* the action steps in that workflow. This understanding is important to take in as you plan your security, or you may get unexpected results.

Let's look at an example to illustrate:

Adding some information to a list of users

Let's imagine that we have a Bubble app with 100 users. As we start exploring how to work with an external system through the Bubble API, we realize we need to add some data to all of those users. Essentially, we want to make a change to all of them.

We decide to set up an API Workflow to do that job, and we open up for external access so that this can be triggered from the external app.

![workflow-vs-data@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fbg2ski9QfRGh7r7N2FGx%2Fworkflow-vs-data%402x.png?alt=media&token=847cc04c-2b0e-4560-bb99-36f6744f3824)

In the case of this API workflow we are in principle going through *two* rounds of authorization: first that the client is authorized to execute the workflow. and then which users they are able to search for.

Here's where the *workflow versus data* point becomes interesting. In this case, we are only authenticating once, but in principle we are going through *two* rounds of authorization:

- Is the client allowed to run this workflow?
- **Is the client allowed to** ***search for these users?***

With this example, you can see why this could sometimes generate an unexpected result: while the client *does* have access to execute the workflow, they may not be able to actually search through all the users in the database.

Why is that? Because that data is protected by **privacy rules**, and the client does not match the needed credentials to download all of them. The unexpected result in this case might be that only a portion (or none) of the users were changed, as privacy rules stopped the client from finding them.

With the Data API, you can set specific privacy rules such as *Modify via API, Create via API* and so forth. Note that these settings **apply to the Data API specifically**; they do **not** affect an API workflow's ability to perform those operations.

Overriding privacy rules

If you want to give the broadest possible access level to your data, an API workflow can be set up to ignore privacy rules altogether. Again, we generally caution against using this method as it gives free access to *all* data in your database regardless of the privacy rules set.

![open-access-api-workflow@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FPPvRx9PDrhXmi07wLPR9%2Fopen-access-api-workflow%402x.png?alt=media&token=3d057c87-f644-4078-93ab-226dc93c545e)

Still, there are many scenarios where this is useful: just make sure you understand the implications of the setting.

Conditions

If you are unfamiliar with conditional expressions, we highly recommend reading the article below to get an understanding of how they work.

Article: [Conditions](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/conditions) Article: [Dynamic expressions](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/dynamic-expressions)​

In this second step of authorization you would likely be more deliberate about its implementation: conditions.

Conditions can be added to the workflow itself or to any of its action steps and the result would be the same. Bubble will check the condition against the client trying to execute the workflow, adding another layer of authorization.

Keep in mind that privacy rules can also influence conditions. For instance, if a condition depends on a database search to validate, it may not yield the expected results if the results are constrained by privacy rules.

![api-workflow-condition@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FfmQJx3ajB6IsxDK7rzRm%2Fapi-workflow-condition%402x.png?alt=media&token=34145d3d-d671-445f-8754-03feea41e2b4)

In the example above, we've further restricted one of the actions in the API workflow by adding a condition that checks whether the current user (the authenticated client running the API workflow) as a field called *Admin* set to *yes*. If this returns a no, the step will not run.

Workflow API security checklist

- **Keep the principle of least access in mind** ([link](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/security/api-security/workflow-api-securitthe-principle-of-least-privilege))
- **Decide who has access (authentication)** First, decide who has access to the data API:
   - No one ([link](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/security/api-security/workflow-api-securitno-one-has-access))
   - Selected clients and workflows ([link](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/security/api-security/workflow-api-securitsome-clients-have-access-to-selected-api-workflows))
   - All clients ([link](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/security/api-security/workflow-api-securitthe-principle-of-least-privilege))
- **Decide what they have access to (authorization)**
   - Enable only the API workflows you want to expose ([link](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/security/api-security/workflow-api-securitsome-clients-have-access-to-selected-api-workflows))
   - Use privacy rules to control what data the workflow can find ([link](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/security/api-security/workflow-api-securitdata-privacy-rules))
   - Use conditions to apply more fine-grained authorization ([link](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/security/api-security/workflow-api-securitconditions))

 Cookies set by Bubble

By default, Bubble sets a couple of cookies on end-users and visitors of your Bubble app. These are for authentication purposes and enable key functionality of the Bubble platform, such as keeping an end-user logged in, being able to tie a visitor to an app user through sign-up, etc.

To be specific, here are the cookies Bubble sets by default:

- One to mark the user’s session ID
- One with the session signature to prevent tampering
- One that tells the browser who the current user is

In addition, you may see a cookie (__cfduid) from Cloudflare (a feature which is provided by Bubble for all apps), which is described [here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-Understanding-the-Cloudflare-Cookie12345682) but is being deprecated by Cloudflare [starting May 2021](https://blog.cloudflare.com/deprecating-cfduid-cookie/).

Note that there is a [setting](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/application-settings/generado-not-set-cookies-on-new-visitors-by-default) for your app that stops Bubble from setting cookies on new visitors; this is off by default.

Also, various plugins that you choose to install in your app may also set cookies on the app's visitors or end-users. If a plugin does this, Bubble has no way to offer finer-grained control over those cookies. If this is a concern to you, we recommend you try installing the plugin and seeing what cookies are set in run-mode to determine if it's appropriate for your use case.

 Security checklist

Before reading this article, keep in mind that a checklist can’t cover all possible security scenarios or threats. Consider it a useful starting point but remember that your app is a unique project that may warrant additional security measures not covered here.

We recommend reading our in-depth guides, continuing to educate yourself on Bubble app security best practices and get in touch with our [Success team](https://bubble.io/contact) if you have any questions. Ensuring the security of your app is ultimately your responsibility, but we will do our best to provide you with the resources you need.

In this section we will cover many of the typical points that need to be checked and re-checked as your app goes through the first and continued deployments.

Planning

- Plan the different parts of your security structure before you start building:
   - ​Data types​
   - ​Pages​
   - ​User roles​

Bubble account security

- Use a strong password​
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)​
- Create and maintain a password and 2FA policy for all collaborators​

App access security

- Don’t give collaborators more access than they need
- Remove collaborators that no longer need access
- Maintain a policy for access to the live database

Database

- Add privacy rules to all private data types
- Use *Only when* conditions to protect data from unauthorized editing in workflows or use auto-binding in combination with privacy rules
- Be mindful of who has access if you copy your Live database to Development

Page security

- Don’t store sensitive data in page elements and workflows​
- Be mindful of other details that are visible in Bubble’s Javascript files​
   - Name of pages
   - Name of data types and default values
   - Information stored in the API Connector​
   - Names and attributes of Option sets​
   - Names and strings saved in application texts​
   - Use the App optimizer to remove deleted data from the code
- Don’t store sensitive data in URL parameters​

Plugins and custom headers

- Plugins and custom headers may affect security – make sure they come from a trusted source

 Sub-apps

Sub-applications are a powerful feature available in the Team plan. The feature sets up a relationship between a “main app” and one or more “sub-applications” and makes it easier to push any changes from the main app to its sub-apps, while all main and sub-apps have their own database.

This is especially useful for certain ideas that involve setting up different (sub/)domains for different clients, which is common in SaaS applications.

Creating new sub-apps

The feature can be found in Settings > Sub-apps. There, you can create a sub-app using the current app as the main app. This will create a copy of the main app with the new name that you pick. The new sub-app will appear in your “My apps” dashboard (and will note which app is the parent), but from that point on, it generally functions as its own app.

You cannot create a sub-app off of a sub app, but one main app can have multiple sub-apps.

Pushing from the main app to sub-apps

However, one of the main features of a sub-app is that at any time, you can “push” the current version of your main app to all of its sub-apps. Note that this will overwrite any changes made to a sub app individually. (This feature can take a relatively longer time for complex apps.)

Certain settings on an app will **not** transfer from the main app to a sub-app upon a push:

- ​**Custom domain**​
- ​**Favicon**​
- Admin's email
- Setting to allow iframes
- Language of the app
- iOS meta tag icon and variations of startup images
- OAuth client app and "redirected to" domain
- Whether or not Sendgrid is used, Sendgrid verification and Sendgrid template ID
- Setting for "Use field display instead of ID for key names" (Settings > API)
- The app's public and private JSON web key (Settings > API)

If you want a specific other setting to **not** propagate from the main app to a sub-app, please contact our Success team - we may be able to add a custom protection to that setting for your app.

**Understanding page load times:** When you update your app, Bubble optimizes it in the background for faster future loads. After significant changes, the initial load might be slower while these optimizations occur. This delay, typically brief, won't recur until the next major update.

This optimization happens separately for Development and Live, so infrequent deployments to live may make this more noticeable.

Main app vs sub-app databases

Sub-apps have separate databases from the main app, but can connect with the main app’s database through the App Connector just like any other app.

In other words, the main app’s database will not transfer to sub-apps automatically. Default values, however, are stored in the app rather than directly in the database, so they will transfer to sub apps on a push.

Sub-app subscriptions

Each sub-app would be on its own Bubble subscription, but sub-apps do not need to be on the Team plan - only the main app does.

If you have a subscription to a plugin on your main app, it would *not carry over* to your sub-app(s) and your sub-app(s) would need to re-purchase that plugin.

----
 Bubble release tiers

The Bubble engine is evolving all the time - on a typical workday, we'll have multiple code rollouts representing any combination of bug fixes, infrastructure improvements, new features, and more.

Every app is on a particular "release tier", which corresponds to when it receives these code rollouts to the Bubble engine.

Immediate release (default)

By default, any such Bubble code rollout will get immediately applied to all Bubble apps - we call this **"immediate release"**.

Note that occasionally, a change in the Bubble platform will be labeled a breaking change from before, a situation which creates a new "Bubble engine version". This means that we are changing the behavior of an existing Bubble feature in a way that we think is an improvement (usually this is in the context of a bug fix), but because existing apps may be relying on the old behavior, we do not want to forcibly upgrade all apps to the new code.

In these situations, apps can control when this new particular behavior is applied via *Settings > Versions*. This way, you can upgrade Bubble version on your development version when convenient for you and test out the impact of that change. When your app on the new Bubble version looks good to you, you can deploy to live just like any other change to your app. In other words, upgrading the Bubble version of your development version does not automatically upgrade the Bubble version of your live version - you must deploy.

If an app is on an older Bubble version (i.e. any version that's not the latest one), it will still receive any code updates that are rolled out since the breaking change, just not the breaking change itself (or any future breaking changes).

Scheduled release

Apps on the Growth plan and above can elect to receive Bubble engine updates a bit of time after they are rolled out. This setting is in Settings > Versions and is called **"scheduled release"**. On scheduled release, the app will not get Bubble engine updates immediately.

Rather, apps on scheduled release will all get Bubble updates once a day (in the morning ET, though the exact time each day may vary), *only if* the Bubble codebase has not changed for a certain number of hours. This once-a-day update will contain all the platform updates since the last scheduled release. Note that some days, this release may not happen at all.

This feature can be useful for app creators that would rather not receive Bubble engine updates immediately because they want to reduce the risk of their app changing many times during a day.

Caveats and notes:

- In the event a code change is deemed very important (e.g. an urgent bug fix), the Bubble team still has the ability and right to roll out that specific code change immediately at any time, even for apps on scheduled release
- Certain infrastructure rollouts occur outside of this release system, i.e. could get rolled out at any time.
- If your app was on scheduled release and you switch it to immediate release, it will immediately get up to the most recent code release and immediately get all releases after that.
- If your app was on immediate release and you switch it to scheduled release, the platform for your app will shift to the last release that all scheduled release apps received, meaning your app may move *backwards* to a slightly older version of the codebase.
   - Please be cautious using very newly rolled out features if you intend to switch from scheduled to immediate release imminently.

Dedicated release

All apps on the Enterprise plan with dedicated hardware are on a different release tier called **"dedicated release".** In fact, dedicated instances have full control over when new Bubble code is applied to their instance. Dedicated users will see a special icon towards the upper right of their editor to manage the Bubble engine version their instance is running.

Generally speaking, every morning there is a new dedicated release version available to choose, containing any Bubble engine updates from the day prior.

Dedicated instances do not have to upgrade Bubble version at any time, though we highly recommend that such updates happen often, so that the dedicated instance can benefit from the latest bug fixes, new features, etc.

Note: this is only available for apps on an Enterprise - Dedicated plan. Apps on the Enterprise - Standard plan have access to Immediate and Scheduled release (above).

 Hosting and scaling

This section explores how Bubble hosts your app

Bubble is frequently referred to as a "no-code" tool or a "visual programming language." While both terms aptly describe Bubble's functionality, they don't tell the full story - Bubble is also a hosting and service provider that offers a range of hardware and software capabilities.

Bubble is a fully cloud-based service, similar to many popular applications of today. In practice, this means that both your app and the editor you use to build that app lives in your browser and is available at all times without having to install or maintain any local files. As long as you are online, you can log in from any device and continue your work where you left off. It also means that Bubble is constantly updated with new features, security measures and fixes.

More than a language, Bubble is a *platform* for building web applications, and this type of service is often called *platform-as-a-service* – or PaaS. In this article, we'll explore what kind of services our platform offers, and how it helps you build, deploy and run your app. We'll also cover what *scaling* means, and how Bubble lets you grow your app's feature set and user base seamlessly.

Hosting - how Bubble hosting works and what it includes

When you set up a Bubble app, we automatically host all the needed server resources and capabilities needed for the app to be built, deployed and used. This article explores what this means, as well as the details regarding the actual physical servers.

Article: [How Bubble hosting works](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/hosting-and-scaling/how-bubble-hosting-works)​

Scaling - how Bubble lets you scale your app seamlessly

As you launch your app and your user base starts to grow, the consumption of server resources may increase over time. Bubble has multiple features built in to make sure that you can safely welcome new users without instability, downtime or cumbersome manual server management. This article covers what this means.

Bubble's engine

Whenever you access the Bubble editor or load a page within your app, there is an active interaction between the device being used and the Bubble server. Here, the Bubble software, often referred to as Bubble's proprietary "engine," diligently operates, to keep the editor and the app running.

The Bubble engine connects a range of services with one goal in common: to make it possible for a single developer with no programming experience to design, develop, deploy and maintain a fully functioning web application.

Bubble's engine works predominantly to connect all the different services that Bubble offers to the user's device and maintain communication between them.

The two engines

You can see Bubble's engine as consisting of two modules: one on the server, and the other on the local device of the user. This is true both for you as a developer when you use the Bubble editor, and for users who visit your app.

![two-engines-bubble.jpeg](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FHRnZm8Y5GxPRTxSVZDYw%2Ftwo-engines-bubble.jpeg?alt=media&token=786afa11-601a-434d-a496-1a34c27e0b57)

The local engine consists of a collection of files that are downloaded to the browser when a page or the editor is loaded, and it establishes a connection with its twin engine on the server to operate.

Database

Every app that you create comes with two ready-to-use databases (one for Development and one for Live). Bubble has automated most of the processes that usually require a dedicated person or team to operate, such as:

- **Database Setup**: Bubble automatically creates and configures the databases (Development and Live) when you start a new app. You don't need to worry about any setup or maintenance tasks.
- **Schema Management**: You can define your app's data structure visually. You don't have to write SQL queries or manage database schema manually as this is managed automatically.
- **Backups**: Point-in-time backups are created continuously for any change in the Development and Live database individually.
   - **Restoring backups:** You can also restore one or all data types to any point in time
- **Security**: We provide tools to manage the security aspects of the database, including automated encryption and managing user access with privacy rules. We use AWS RDS’s AES-256 encryption to encrypt data at rest. You can [see for yourself](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=bubble.io&latest) the encryption we use for data in transit.
- **Data Manipulation**: With Bubble's visual programming model, you can manipulate data (Create, Read, Update, Delete operations) without writing code. Bubble automates the process of generating the necessary commands to perform these operations on the database.
- **Uptime**: we continually scan for any downtime and have both automated processes and dedicated teams that ensure a 99.93 % uptime​
- ​**Data API****:** a direct, secure API connection that gives controlled access to read and make changes to your database can be enabled with just a few clicks

The easy communication with the database is facilitated by the two engines constantly communicating.

Backup

Bubble has completely automated the backup process, making sure that you can easily restore your app to an earlier point in time with just a few clicks:

- **App development**: every change you make to your app is logged so that you can not only *undo* changes, but you can create named save points or restore the app to an earlier point in time.
   - ​**Version control**: Bubble also lets you easily create different branches where you can work on separate parts of the app in isolation to make it easy to manage teamwork, feature development and hotfixes
- **Database:** the same point-in-time backups are automatically handled for both the Development and Live database individually

Server Logs

Every process performed by the Bubble engine is logged and searchable, meaning you can track what operations have taken place and navigate to the exact workflow where the process took place. The logs also give you a full overview of the user and parameters associated with each action.

File storage

Uploading and using files is fully automated and secure, allowing you to work with files that can be kept private to each user. Files are hosted on the endpoint `cdn.bubble.io`.

Related articles

CDN

An essential feature of high-performing web applications is the implementation of a *Content Delivery Network*, or CDN. A CDN is a system that distributes copies of your data and content across a network of servers located around the globe, ensuring fast accessibility regardless of a user's geographical location. Each Bubble app is integrated with Cloudflare, a leading provider of web infrastructure services. This integration not only ensures rapid delivery of files worldwide but also bolsters your app's security against potential threats and cyberattacks.

API

Bubble's engine also offers an easy way to set up APIs:

- The **Data API** allows external apps to connect securely to your databases to read and make changes to it
- The **Workflow API** allows external apps to trigger workflows in your app.

How Bubble hosts apps

Bubble's servers are hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), a leading cloud services platform known for its robust security and scalability. Bubble uses many of the services that AWS offers to run the editor and apps, which means they are regularly audited by independent third parties and continually tested and optimized as a result of being used by millions of other software systems outside of the Bubble sphere.

AWS security

The security aspect is taken care of by AWS's comprehensive set of security tools and best practices. They have multiple layers of operational and physical security to ensure the integrity and safety of data. This includes features like keeping data centers safe from physical harm (such as natural disasters, power failures and overheating), data encryption, network firewalls, and secure access controls.

Amazon AWS is compliant with certifications such as SOC 2, CSA, ISO 27001, and more.

FAQ: Hosting your app on Bubble

Can I move my app to a server of my choice?

Since Bubble operates on its proprietary engine, which is consistently maintained and updated, the migration of your app away from Bubble's hosting is not possible. However, Bubble does provide an alternative in the form of a dedicated server environment, enabling you to have a secluded and more adjustable server control as well as a static IP. You can read more about this in our article series on the [Enterprise plan](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/bubble-for-enterprise). We recommending getting in touch with our [Sales team](https://bubble.io/contact-sales) to discuss the possibility of setting up a dedicated environment.

Can I choose the geographical location of where my app is hosted?

Bubble's shared server environment is hosted in the US, and we don't currently offer the possibility of changing that location. Our [Enterprise plan](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/bubble-for-enterprise), on the other hand, lets you choose the AWS region where you want your app to be hosted. We recommending getting in touch with our [Sales team](https://bubble.io/contact-sales) to discuss the possibility of setting up a dedicated environment.

Can I get a static IP on Bubble?

Bubble's shared server environment doesn't currently offer the possibility of assigning a static IP address. Our [Enterprise plan](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/bubble-for-enterprise), on the other hand, lets you set this up. We recommending getting in touch with our [Sales team](https://bubble.io/contact-sales) to discuss the possibility of setting up a dedicated environment.

 Scaling with Bubble

This section covers what it means to scale your Bubble app, and the tools we provide to ensure that scaling happens smoothly

What scaling means

Scaling can mean many things, but in the context of this article, we'll focus on the following definition:

Scaling in Bubble means an increase in the consumption of server resources over an extended period of time
In the majority of cases, *scaling* is the result of more users signing up and actively using your app. But scaling can also be the result of other changes, such as:

- Adding new features that require more resources
- Adding connectivity to third-party systems, such as accepting incoming API requests
- Creating or importing a large volume of data that increases the need for searching and processing

Scaling a web application is akin to upgrading a power grid to meet growing electricity demands. Just as additional power plants and transmission lines are required to distribute electricity to a larger population or an increase in electricity usage, scaling your app involves adding more server resources to support the increased user base and data processing needs.

Workload units

Bubble measures the total work that is performed to power your application in a metric called *workload units*. This unit tracks different activity types, such as database queries, workflows, file uploads and API calls and calculates a total.

You can read more about exactly how the workload unit in our dedicated article series on the subject:

Article series: [Pricing and Workload](https://manual.bubble.io/account-and-marketplace/account-and-billing/pricing-plans)​

Because each app is unique and can perform a wide range of different tasks, workload is use-agnostic metric that tracks your actual consumption. You can track each category and task down to single expressions in detailed reports to understand how your app is consuming workload, and to see how your app scales over time.

Each [Bubble plan](https://bubble.io/pricing) comes with a number of workload units and Bubble helps you scale automatically or manually (if you prefer) to facilitate for growth.

How Bubble helps you scale

As we've covered, scaling your app in essence means to increase how much work the server is doing to keep the app running. Bubble is designed to make scaling as seamless and straightforward as possible. Let's look at a few points to learn what that means in practice:

- **We don't** **rate limit****:** Your app will run at the same pace no matter how much workload it consumes: we don't rate limit. Essentially, this means your app can grow and perform consistently, irrespective of the workload it manages.
- **You can scale workload automatically or manually:** we offer a fully automated system that adds workload to your plan immediately as the need arises to facilitate for growth or sudden spikes in traffic or processing. You can also choose to manually add workload units which in some cases can give you a volume discount: you can use our [Subscription planner](https://bubble.io/subscription-planner) tool to see what your best option is.
- **Changes on consumption is communicated clearly:** using the app metrics dashboard we provide a set of reports that detail your workload consumption, and we email you if it reaches a certain percentage so that you can stay on top of it
- **CDN Integration is included:** Through Cloudflare, we provide efficient Content Delivery Network capabilities to ensure quick access to your app globally.
- **We offer a dedicated server option:** if you need more control, we offer a dedicated server environment.

Spikes

When there's a sudden increase in the consumption of server resources, it's often called a *spike.* This can traditionally lead to problems for any website or app, since the server is not set up to handle the unexpected increased need for processing power.

Spikes can happen for many reasons, many of them positive:

- Your app goes viral through social media, an article/video or a platform like ProductHunt, leading to an increase in traffic
- A lot of users try to use the app at the same time: for example, if your app handles *events*, a lot of users could be trying to access exactly when the event starts, but your traffic is otherwise stable
- A change in the app requires major changes in the database, and you need to do some heavy processing to facilitate (once or regularly)

Bubble's automated scaling is instant and flexible in the way that it doesn't bump you to a higher plan, making the cost increase permanent. It simply adds the workload units needed to handle the spike, keeping you on the same plan as before. If you expect a spike in advance, you may make it even more cost-efficient by pre-purchasing workload units. Again, you can use our [Subscription planner](https://bubble.io/subscription-planner) tool to see what your best option is.

How many users can Bubble handle?

This is a question that needs to be looked at more carefully to answer. It's tempting to see scaling simply as the number of users, since it's such an easy metric to measure. However, it's important to note that what we are *really* talking about when it comes to scaling is the total amount of server resources those users consume.

The easiest way to illustrate this is to think in terms of active and inactive users; inactive users spend little or no server resources and as such can be scaled almost indefinitely in principle. Active users on the other hand may spend a small or large amount of resources, depending on what your app does.

Understanding your product

To understand exactly how *your* app scales, it's helpful to drill into the actual mechanics of how it is used. Scaling is a process that rests on three pillars:

- Bubble's scaling capabilities
- The kind of work that your app does
- How efficiently your app is built

While Bubble is designed from a foundational level to make it easy and cost-effective to scale, the platform's flexibility also makes it possible to set up apps that don't perform as well as they could, consuming more server resources than necessary.

Scaling is mostly affected by the use of your database. An app with just few users could in principle consume a high level of server resources if you perform heavy database processing on a regular basis, and the opposite would also be true: lightweight database operations multiplied by a large volume of users can lead to a high consumption as well.

Predicting where your product falls on that spectrum can help you optimize your app, ask for advice from our Success team and forum members.

 CDN (Cloudflare)

![image.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fb1DNciV3tVLrl4mOrPI5%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=d4792994-fb85-4365-87d0-eec0232bd9ae)

Cloudflare is one of the leading content delivery network (CDN) providers in the world. At its core, a CDN is a network of servers strategically located around the globe to deliver web content to users more quickly and efficiently. Bubble uses Cloudflare's CDN to enhance the performance of Bubble-built applications. But how do these two technologies work together? Let’s break it down.

**How a CDN works**

Before delving into how the CDN operates, it's essential to understand the traditional web hosting model. Without a CDN, your Bubble app would reside on a single server in one geographic location. Users from all around the world would send requests to this central server. As you can imagine, the farther away the user is from this server, the longer it takes for data to travel, leading to potential latency issues.

Enter Cloudflare. When Bubble employs Cloudflare’s CDN, your application’s static content (like images, uploaded files, and JavaScript files) is cached (or saved) across Cloudflare's extensive network of servers around the world. When a user accesses your Bubble app, Cloudflare determines the nearest server to that user and serves the cached content from that location.

While static content can be cached, dynamic content (like data in the database) is not. This means that any interaction you have with the database in your app still happens on Bubble's server.

**Benefits beyond speed**

Beyond speed improvements, Cloudflare offers other advantages:

- **Security**: Cloudflare acts as a protective shield, absorbing malicious traffic and mitigating DDoS attacks before they reach your app.
- **Uptime**: Cloudflare’s vast network means that even if one server faces issues, another can take its place, ensuring more consistent uptime.
- **SSL**: Cloudflare provides SSL encryption, ensuring that data between the user and server remains secure.

**Integration with Bubble**

The integration with Cloudflare is seamless and automated. Bubble handles the complexities behind the scenes, meaning that you can focus on building without diving deep into networking intricacies.

Customizing Cloudflare

On the Enterprise plan, we offer customization of the Cloudflare settings for your app. To learn more, get in touch with Sales.

 Domain and DNS

A Bubble app comes automatically with a [bubbleapps.io](http://bubbleapps.io) subdomain. For instance, [yourapp.bubbleapps.io](http://yourapp.bubbleapps.io). The [bubbleapps.io](http://bubbleapps.io) has SSL/TLS encryption enabled automaticalle.

If you want to customize this and use your own domain name, you can do this in the Domain section of the Settings Tab.

[](https://youtu.be/vGk6nfq41L4)

Our Academy tutorial on how to add your custom domain

Setting up a domain

You can use a domain that you own with any registrar service and configure it to point to Bubble. This operation is done in two steps:

- Set up the domain in Bubble
- Set up the DNS records in the registrar's interface to point to Bubble

To set up the domain with your app, enter the domain in the input box in the Domain Tab and click 'Set up this domain'. Once you've done this, Bubble will provide the DNS records that you should enter on the registrar's end.

![cloudflare_2.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/f1585326016567x929336103838776600/cloudflare_2.png)

Once you have the DNS from Bubble, you do not have any setting to modify in Bubble. You should instead head to the registrar service that you use to manage your domain and find the DNS section (or DNS Zone File). Once you have found that section, delete existing A records whose name is '' (empty) and 'www', and instead add the records as indicated above. (Some registrars use '@' to refer to the empty domain.)

This process can be a little technical, and each registrar has a different interface. If you need help, we recommend reaching out to the registrar's customer support to get assistance to modify the records. Don't hesitate to ask for help on the [forum](https://forum.bubble.io/) as it's likely another user will have experience with the same registrar service.

After setting up the DNS records, the new settings need to propagate across the internet. This can take up to 24 hours, but usually you should see some results after 2-4 hours. Bubble lets you check the success of the operation below the records, and you can check the process by clicking on the 'Check my settings' button.

![check_settings.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/f1585326315667x650590897164695400/check_settings.png)

As soon as a domain is properly configured, all requests to [yourapp.bubbleapps.io](http://yourapp.bubbleapps.io) will automatically be redirected to [yourdomain.com](http://yourdomain.com).

Setting up a subdomain

If you already are using a domain and would like to use a subdomain to point to your Bubble app (for instance, [app.yourdomain.com](http://app.yourdomain.com)), you can do this by simply using this as the domain in the input box. The DNS records will be different, but the process of entering them in your registrar service is similar as above.

![domain_2.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/f1585326392611x258988241113315520/domain_2.png)

Configuring DNS records

*If you had a custom domain name assigned to your Bubble app prior to October 2019, you are considered a* ***Legacy Customer**. If you have never assigned a custom domain to your Bubble app before, ignore the instructions marked for Legacy Customers.*

([example.com](http://example.com)) or ([www.example.com](http://www.example.com))

Your users will generally expect to be able to load your domain on `example.com` and`www.example.com`. For SEO purposes, we redirect exactly one of these to the other address.

For instance, if you enter `example.com` as your custom domain, we will automatically redirect `www.example.com` to `example.com`—as long as your DNS records are correct!

When you choose your custom domain, Bubble will instruct you to create **four** records at your registrar. The records will be of the form

Type: A Name: Value: [104.xxx.xxx.xxx](http://104.xxx.xxx.xxx)

Type: A Name: Value: [104.xxx.xxx.xxx](http://104.xxx.xxx.xxx)

Type: A Name: www Value: [104.xxx.xxx.xxx](http://104.xxx.xxx.xxx)

Type: A Name: www Value: [104.xxx.xxx.xxx](http://104.xxx.xxx.xxx)

These are provided for redundancy, but in most cases your custom domain will work identically with either or both, so long as you have at least one record for the bare domain and one for www.

([app.example.com](http://app.example.com))

If your custom domain is of the form `app.example.com`, you can register the custom domain in your Bubble app, in Settings -> Domain.

Bubble will instruct you to create two records at your registrar. The records will be of the form

Type: A Name: app Value: [104.xxx.xxx.xxx](http://104.xxx.xxx.xxx)

Type: A Name: app Value: [104.xxx.xxx.xxx](http://104.xxx.xxx.xxx)

These are provided for redundancy, but in most cases your custom domain will work identically with either or both.

You can enter these at your registrar:

![cloudflare_3.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/f1585326026071x868474454189470500/cloudflare_3.png)

Once Bubble and Cloudflare verify your domain has been updated, your custom domain will work!

Changing/removing a domain

If you need to change your domain, you should first remove the current domain. Clicking on 'delete this domain name' will terminate the connection between the application and the domain. Note that your domain will still point to Bubble's server until you remove the DNS records in the registrar service. A Bubble page will be displayed with a message indicating there is no app linked to this domain. Once you have removed the domain, you can add a new domain as described above.

Note that if you remove a domain and want to use an [appname.bubbleapps.io](http://appname.bubbleapps.io) domain as initially happens, you may have to clear the browser cache, as the redirection is usually cached at the browser level.

A domain change, once complete, should not effect or render invalid any dynamic URL expressions. Uploaded files are stored on S3/appforest rather than on the domain directly, so everything should redirect appropriately.

SSL encryption (HTTPS)

If you created your account after October 2019, SSL is mandatory. If you are on a Legacy (pre-2019) Personal Plan and higher, you can activate SSL encryption on your custom domain. Note that all apps hosted on a [bubbleapps.io](http://bubbleapps.io) subdomain also offer SSL support on all plans. Using SSL encryption lets you guarantee to your users that no one can intercept traffic between them and your site, and protects their private information. SSL encryption also helps with search engine rankings, and can be required to use some features (access to geolocation on Chrome, using Stripe payments, etc.).

Setting up SSL

Once you have properly configured your domain and that Bubble has validated the A records, you can start the process. To have SSL activated on your site, enable the checkbox.

![ssl.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/f1585326519363x366539373251776960/ssl.png)

This change can take up to one hour to propagate. For customers using Cloudflare, SSL is mandatory.

Domain & DNS FAQs

Q: How long does it take for my domain to move to Cloudflare?

A. Two minutes to several hours, depending on how long your DNS records take to update.

The moment you register your custom domain with Bubble and Cloudflare, your domain is registered with both services. In order for it to work correctly, Cloudflare needs to validate that your DNS entries point to their servers.

When you update your DNS records (adding, removing, or renaming a record), the length of time they stay available is determined by the record's **TTL** (time-to-live) value.

Let's say you change a record at your registrar, and that record has a TTL of 1 hour. After 1 hour, you can be certain that **that** server is reporting your new record to the internet. However, there are many name servers on the internet, and all of them will need to have your most up-to-date record. **On average**, you can expect your records to be broadcast across the internet within twice the length of your TTL. So if your TTL is 1 hour, expect your record to be everywhere after 2 hours.

Once your record has been updated everywhere, Cloudflare will be able to verify that you own the domain, and your app will become active.

Q. I am a Legacy Customer; what should I do to temporarily disable Cloudflare?

A. Change your DNS records back to the A record you were previously using.

If you're having problems that you think might be caused by Cloudflare, you can temporarily disable Cloudflare by changing your DNS records from `A 104.xxx.xxx.xxx` to the A record you were previously assigned.

When you've identified what the problem was and are ready to turn Cloudflare back on, delete the A record and replace it with the A records Bubble provided you.

Q. Why are my users are getting "This Connection is Not Secure" errors?

A. Cloudflare has not validated your domain yet.

If you click on "Advanced" and then look at the certificate details, and the certificate is of the form `ssl123456.cloudflare.net`, your DNS entry is pointing to the correct place, but Cloudflare has not validated your domain yet. Please wait an hour and check again.

Q. How do I know my site is working on Cloudflare?

A. There are several tools.

The first, to check to see if your domain records have propagated, is the [Google DNS lookup tool](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/).

When you've changed your domain records, you can go to the A record tab to check to see if your A record has propagated.

[mywebpage.us](http://mywebpage.us). 299 IN A 104.19.241.93

[mywebpage.us](http://mywebpage.us). 299 IN A 104.19.240.93

You can also take advantage of a service like [What's my DNS](https://www.whatsmydns.net/), which tests your custom domain from many locations all over the world. It's not uncommon to see a few blank entries on this page; what you're looking for is any records that return an error (red X) or different results than you are expecting.

Cloudflare serves a page on a certain route on every site hosted on their domain at `/cdn-cgi/trace`. You can see bubble's page at [bubble.io/cdn-cgi/trace](http://bubble.io/cdn-cgi/trace); replace '[bubble.io](http://bubble.io)' with your own custom domain (once it loads) to see if it's working.

The output should look somewhat like this:

fl=xxxxx

[h=bubble.io](http://h=bubble.io)

[ip=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx](http://ip=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)

ts=1572657558.41

visit_scheme=http

uag=Mozilla/5.0 [...]

colo=EWR

http=http/1.1

loc=US

tls=off

sni=off

warp=off

Q. I've followed all the instructions here, and I still get "This Connection is Not Secure." What gives?

A. It's possible that we cannot issue SSL certificates on your domain. You will have to remove your CAA record and try again.

Go to the Google DNS lookup tool's [CAA tab](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/digCAA/) and check to see if your bare domain (e.g. `example.com`) has a CAA record. A CAA record restricts which certificate providers can issue certificates for your domain. (Only about 1% of Bubble apps have a CAA record.)

For instance, when you look up `google.com` with this tool, you can see the following record:

id 61662

opcode QUERY

rcode NOERROR

flags QR RD RA

;QUESTION

[google.com](http://google.com). IN CAA

;ANSWER

[google.com](http://google.com). 21599 IN CAA 0 issue "pki.goog"

;AUTHORITY

;ADDITIONAL

This means that *only* `pki.goog` is allowed to issue certificates for sites across the `google.com` domain.

SSL Certificate issuance is a critical part of making your site work on Bubble and Cloudflare, so if you find a CAA record, delete it. Your site should begin working in a matter of minutes.

Q. I just turned Cloudflare on, and now I'm getting 525 errors on my site! What's happening?

A. Wait an hour and check again.

If you are a Legacy Customer who wasn't using SSL prior to switching over to Cloudflare, some of Bubble's servers won't have your updated certificate available to them. A 525 error happens when the Origin Server (where your app is hosted on Bubble) serves nonsecure content (http) to a server that is expecting secure content (https). We refresh your SSL and certificate settings on all servers once per hour, so if you've recently changed your settings wait and try again.

Q. What should I do if I'm getting 1001 errors?

A. Verify your A records.

Cloudflare needs to confirm that your A records correctly point to Bubble's IP addresses. Encountering a 1001 DNS Resolution Error often indicates improper DNS record setup. It's crucial to include only the specific A records we've provided in your DNS settings. Remove any extra A records linked to your domain.

If the A records are accurate but you're still seeing the 1001 error, consider reaching out to our Support team through our [Support center](https://bubble.io/support) for further assistance.

Q. I am getting 1014 errors on my site

A. If you're using Cloudflare for DNS, turn off proxying.

The most common cause of 1014 errors is when you're using Cloudflare for DNS, and you're using an "orange cloud" (proxy) setting. Click the orange cloud to turn off proxying (resulting in a grey cloud).

Q. I am having another issue post Cloudflare transition that's not answered here. What should I do?

A. That depends.

You can [search the forum](https://forum.bubble.io/) to see if anyone else has had the same issue as you.

If you can't find an answer here or there, submit a bug report.

----
 Bubble app names

App names are used for indexing purposes on Bubble's side, so they cannot be changed or reused once the app is created. Once you are on a custom domain, however, the app name is no longer visible to your end users.

If you are looking to change your app's name, you can create a copy of your existing app with the new app name that you prefer. However, if your app is currently on a paid plan or has any plugin licenses, please do keep in mind that those cannot be transferred to the new app.

Bubble app names cannot be reused, even if the app is deleted, as Bubble app names must remain unique; information about deleted apps are still retained even after they are deleted.

When you're developing on Bubble, it's essential to get familiar with different compliance frameworks. They're not just a checklist; they're about building trust, ensuring your users' privacy, and meeting all the necessary legal requirements.

In this article series, you'll learn about some of the top compliance frameworks and how they fit into your app's development on Bubble. Keep in mind that compliance is an ongoing process, and it's essential to stay up-to-date with the latest developments to ensure your app remains in line with regulatory standards.

While we list some of the most widely applied compliance frameworks below, there are a range of industries that in some regions require a strong adherence to strict security and privacy standards.

Typical industries that have higher requirements include:

- Finance
- Healthcare
- Insurance
- Telecommunications
- Education
- Legal services
- Energy and utilities
- Government and public sector

If your app belongs to any of these categories or any other where you anticipate higher security expectations, it's important to get to know the applicable local and (if needed) global frameworks.

Understanding these regulations can help ensure that your app remains compliant.

If you have questions or concerns about your project, we encourage you to [reach out to our Success team](https://bubble.io/contact). They can help determine whether Bubble is the right platform for your project and offer guidance on how to plan and develop your app.

 GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation

What is the GDPR?

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a data protection and privacy regulation established and enforced by the European Union (EU). Implemented in May 2018, the GDPR prescribes how individual’s personal data can be collected and used, including the options websites must offer users regarding their personal data. The GDPR was implemented in the United Kingdom after it left the EU.

GDPR represents a major milestone in tech regulation history, as it applies not only to companies based in the EU but also to companies with users in the EU. Given that many Bubble apps cater to a global audience, it's possible that your app may be subject to these regulations, even if your company and/or server are situated outside the EU.

GDPR applies to tech companies handling personal data in a commercial context. It requires websites to provide notice of personal data collection, usage, and sharing, establish a legal basis for data processing, and respect individual’s rights to access, portability, and deletion of their personal data, for example.

If you're interested in learning more about Bubble and GDPR, we recommend checking out our dedicated blog post that delves deeper into various aspects of GDPR regulations.

Blog post: [Bubble GDPR intro guide](https://bubble.io/blog/bubble-gdpr/)​

At the bottom of this page is a [GDPR terminology table](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/compliance/gdpgdpr-terminology).

Is Bubble GDPR compliant?

Bubble takes the protection of personal data seriously. We have implemented measures designed to meet the requirements of the GDPR (and other applicable data privacy laws).

However, this does not mean however that your app built on Bubble is automatically compliant. To use the GDPR terminology, you are likely a Data Controller for personal data on your app (and Bubble is a Data Processor and our processors are Sub-processors to you).

What this means is that the tools you use (including your Data Processors and Sub-processors) must comply with the GDPR (which is a big step toward your own compliance), but you still have to set up each individual app and documentation in the right way in order for it to be compliant with the GDPR.

> You can take advantage of Bubble’s capabilities to help meet your GDPR obligations.

Do I have to have a server in the EU to be compliant?

No, you do not necessarily have to use an EU-based server to host the personal data to be GDPR compliant. However, the GDPR imposes rules on transferring to or accessing personal data from outside the European Union. If your app processes personal data of EU residents and stores it on a non-EU server, you must ensure that the data transfer is in compliance with the GDPR.

Standard contractual clauses

Under the GDPR, transferring personal data from the EU to countries with lower data protection standards, including the US, is restricted. To overcome this, the EU has developed Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), which are pre-approved sets of contractual provisions designed to ensure that personal data transferred outside of the EU is adequately protected and meets the GDPR requirements.

> After the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that Privacy Shield was not a permissible transfer mechanism, Bubble incorporated the Standard Contractual Clauses into its DPAs.
When using SCCs, you agree to follow specific rules and principles regarding the processing and protection of personal data. This helps ensure that the personal data of EU residents is treated with the same level of care and protection as it would be within the EU.
As a Bubble developer, incorporating SCCs into your data processing agreements with your customers and service providers can be an essential step in becoming GDPR compliant. By doing so, you provide assurances that the personal data of your EU users is being handled securely and responsibly in compliance with the GDPR, regardless of where your server is located.
Bubble serves as a data processor for your company when you deploy your app and end-users sign up for an account on your app, which might be one of several processors you opt to use (an analytics platform like Google Analytics or payment gateway like Stripe are examples of other data processors you may choose to use). It’s important to note that even if Bubble and other processors you work with have made efforts to adhere to GDPR (such as Bubble entering into Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with its processors, who act as your sub-processors), you are still responsible for ensuring your Bubble app is GDPR-compliant.
Bubble has implemented the SCCs into its DPAs with its customers and its processors (your sub-processors). In addition, starting in July 2023, the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework and Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework, the third iteration of a joint EU-US and Swiss-US programs to enable personal data transfers from the EU and Switzerland to the US, became operational. As a participating company in the prior EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks, Bubble is “grandfathered”’ into the new EU-US and Swiss-US Data Privacy Frameworks and will apply the updated Data Privacy Framework Principles, but we will continue to use the SCCs in our DPAs as extra protection.
A frequent inquiry we receive at Bubble is along the lines of” “If you only implemented X, wouldn’t that make you GDPR-compliant?” An example of this is users asking if having an EU data center by itself would guarantee GDPR compliance for Bubble and Bubble apps.
Based on our understanding, the answer is no – merely storing data in an EU data center doesn’t meet all the necessary requirements for GDPR compliance. Similarly, subscribing to Bubble’s Enterprise plan and requesting your own EU-based dedicated Bubble servers is not enough to achieve full compliance with GDPR.

What must I do for my app to be compliant?

While the following list provides a suggested starting point for planning your app’s compliance, it shouldn’t be regarded as all-inclusive or specific to your app.

Ultimately, ensuring your app’s compliance is *your* responsibility as the developer, and you should seek the guidance of qualified legal counsel and other professionals to assist you in this process.

- **Understand the GDPR’s scope:** Determine if the GDPR applies to your app. If your app collects, stores, or processes personal data from EU residents, even if your company is located outside the EU, you must comply with the GDPR.
- **Establish a legal basis for processing data:** Ensure that your app has a legal basis for processing personal data, such as user consent, contract necessity, or a legitimate interest.
- **Provide notice and obtain consent:** Create a clear and transparent privacy notice, explaining what personal data your app collects, how it’s used, and with whom it’s shared. Where necessary, obtain explicit, affirmative consent from users before collecting their data. Ensure that users can easily withdraw their consent at any time.
- **Implement privacy by design:** Incorporate privacy considerations into your app’s design from the outset. Use privacy rules and conditions to protect user data and limit data collection to only what’s necessary.
- **Respect user rights:** Ensure that your app allows users to exercise their rights under the GDPR, including the right to: - access – rectify – erase – restrict processing – port … their personal data.
- **Set up data breach notifications:** Develop a process for detecting and reporting data breaches within no more than 72 hours to the relevant supervisory authority, as required by the GDPR.
- **Manage third-party relationships:** If your app uses plugins or third-party services (such as APIs or external databases) that process personal data, make sure they are GDPR compliant and enter into an appropriate DPAs with them.
- **Set up privacy rules:** Configure privacy rules in Bubble to restrict access to personal data (especially “sensitive” personal data to ensure users access the data they need to and are authorized to see. ’
- **Publish a privacy policy:** Draft and publish a comprehensive privacy policy that explains your app's data processing practices, user rights, and contact information for privacy-related inquiries.

 SOC 2 Type II

This section covers Bubble and SOC 2 compliance

**Legal disclaimer:** This article is meant only to be educational content to help give you a start on these regulatory compliance matters and is strictly not intended to be legal advice. The information presented may not be applicable to your specific situation and may not reflect the most recent developments in this area.

Always consult a qualified legal professional for advice regarding specific regulatory compliance obligations relevant to your circumstances. Details about your speciﬁc idea, app or context could make a diﬀerence in how you approach these obligations.

Moreover, this article is meant to be an introductory- level guide and will not cover all the ﬁne details of these topics.

Bubble has put in place a comprehensive and robust security program to protect all data, including personal data, on your app from a possible data breach or other problem. A description of our security program can be found at: [https://bubble.io/security](https://bubble.io/security). We also continually test our security to make sure it works as it’s supposed to.

What is SOC 2?

SOC 2, short for Service Organization Control 2, is a set of standards that companies follow to manage and secure customer data. It's like a rulebook for handling information, especially when it comes to using a trusted Software as a Service (SaaS) provider like Bubble.

SOC 2 audits and trust principles

SOC 2 reports are issued by independent auditors who assess the effectiveness of an organization's controls according to the criteria established by the [American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)](https://us.aicpa.org/forthepublic).

SOC 2 audits are made in two different ways, Type I and Type II, each serving a different purpose:

- **SOC 2 Type I:** This is like a snapshot of a company's systems and controls at a specific moment in time. It looks at how a company describes its controls and whether they are designed properly. Think of it as checking if all the locks in a house are in place. Type I is more about the planning and structure of the service than how it performs over time.
- **SOC 2 Type II:** This audit is more thorough. It's like checking those locks over a period of time (3 months in Bubble’s case) to see if they actually work, day in and day out. A Type II report doesn't just look at the design of the controls, but also how they operate over a defined period. It digs into the nitty-gritty and makes sure everything is working as it should be.

These audits ultimately lead to a report, which requires that Bubble adheres to at least one of the SOC 2's Trust Principles:

- security
- availability
- integrity
- confidentiality
- privacy

SOC 2 Type II report

Is Bubble SOC 2 compliant?

Yes. Specifically, Bubble is compliant with the SOC 2 Type II standard for security. Bubble has undergone a thorough external audit process by the independent auditor, [Sensiba LLP](https://sensiba.com/solutions/risk-assurance/soc/), and demonstrated that we have effective controls in place to ensure the security of our platform over time.

Looking ahead, we may consider extending our compliance to cover other Trust Principles.

Does that mean my Bubble app is also SOC 2 compliant?

Bubble's SOC 2 Type II report for security means that our platform itself meets the specific standards needed to be compliant. But when it comes to an individual app created using Bubble, the compliance doesn't automatically transfer over.

Think of Bubble like a set of tools in a workshop. We make sure the tools meet certain standards, but how someone uses those tools to build something is up to them. If a user wants their app to be SOC 2 compliant, they'll need to ensure that the way they design and operate the app meets the necessary trust principles and complete a separate audit.

What do I need to do to obtain a SOC 2 report?

Note: the following is a general guide for users looking to make their app compliant with SOC 2 standards while using Bubble. This is not legal or professional compliance advice, and the specific requirements can vary widely depending on factors like your industry, region, or the particular needs of your end users. It's always a good idea to consult a legal or secuity professional who understands your unique situation to ensure that you're meeting all the necessary requirements.

With that said, here's a general overview that might help you get started on your path to compliance.

- **Understand the requirements:** First, figure out what compliance standards you need to meet. SOC 2 has specific trust principles, so understanding what they require will be your starting point. You may want to obtain a report in one or more of the trust principles.
- **Assess your app:** Look at your app and identify where you might be handling sensitive information or where particular security measures need to be in place. Think of this like spotting the weak links in a chain.
- **Implement controls:** Put measures in place to ensure that your app meets security standards. This might involve things like setting up privacy rules and server-side conditions to ensure data remains protected.
- **Documentation:** Keep records of what you're doing to meet security standards. This is essential if you need to prove compliance later.
- **Regular monitoring and testing:** Compliance isn't a one-time thing; you'll need to keep an eye on things and make sure your controls are working as they should be.
- **Consider professional assistance:** Depending on your needs and the complexity of your app, you might want to consider hiring a professional who specializes in compliance. They can help you navigate specific requirements and make sure you're on the right track.
- **Consider Bubble security assistance platforms:** Organizations like Flusk and ncScale can assist by checking for data leaks and safe authentication protocols, performing penetration tests, detecting inefficiencies, monitoring error logs, mapping dependencies, minimizing exposure, and more.
- **Stay informed:** Compliance standards can change, so it's essential to keep up to date with the latest requirements

 HIPAA

This section covers Bubble and HIPAA compliance

**Legal disclaimer:** This article is meant only to be educational content to help give you a start on these regulatory compliance matters and is strictly not intended to be legal advice. The information presented may not be applicable to your specific situation and may not reflect the most recent developments in this area.

Always consult a qualified legal professional for advice regarding specific regulatory compliance obligations relevant to your circumstances. Details about your speciﬁc idea, app or context could make a diﬀerence in how you approach these obligations.

Moreover, this article is meant to be an introductory- level guide and will not cover all the ﬁne details of these topics.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a United States federal law enacted in 1996. It primarily aims to protect the privacy and security of individuals' health information and to establish national standards for the handling of such data. HIPAA applies to healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates who process, store, or transmit Protected Health Information (PHI).

In the context of Bubble app development, if your app collects, stores, or processes PHI, you must ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations. To achieve HIPAA compliance, you need to implement specific administrative, physical, and technical safeguards, as well as enter into Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with any third-party services you use in your app that handle PHI on your behalf.

Is Bubble HIPAA compliant?

HIPAA mandates that all aspects of a service need to be compliant for the overall product to fulfill its requirements. While some sub-processors might be HIPAA compliant, the entire Bubble platform and its internal company processes currently **do not meet these standards**. Consequently, apps built on Bubble won't achieve HIPAA compliance. As a result, it is not advisable to develop applications requiring HIPAA compliance on the Bubble platform.

Can I still build HIPAA compliant apps on Bubble?

While it may be possible to set up your app using third-party solutions that together ensure HIPAA compliance, Bubble cannot support HIPAA compliant apps.

For this reason, we currently do not recommend using Bubble for apps that require HIPAA compliance.

----
 Other frameworks and standards

Apart from GDPR and HIPAA, there are other compliance frameworks and standards for personal and security that may apply to your app. This list is offered only for information purposes and is not comprehensive. You are encouraged to consult with a legal professional to see if any might apply to you and your app and how to comply.

In addition to this list, we have separate articles for [GDPR](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/compliance/gdpr), [SOC 2](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/compliance/soc-2-type-ii) and [HIPAA](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/compliance/hipaa).

Bubble’s infrastructure plays a significant role in the performance, security, scalability, and the overall effectiveness of any solution that you want to build. In this article we’ll shed light on how our Enterprise plan equips large-scale organizations with a robust foundation, tailored to meet the specific demands of enterprise operations.

Dedicated instance

Get maximum reliability with an isolated instance of Bubble that operates on a Bubble-managed AWS server. One dedicated instance can host as many apps as you need.

Choice of hosting region

Specify the region where your server and data are located. Choose from Bubble’s growing list of AWS data center regions:

- Oregon
- Ireland
- London
- Paris
- Frankfurt
- Mumbai
- Singapore
- Tokyo
- Seoul
- Sydney
- São Paulo
- Montreal
- Bahrain.

This capability isn't merely about speed; it's about complying with data sovereignty laws and ensuring that your data is stored in a region that aligns with your business requirements or regulations.

Hosting configuration designed for scale

As your user base expands, our team is consistently monitoring your app's infrastructure to support seamless scaling. We're equipped and ready to make the necessary adjustments to your plan or server configuration to optimize performance.

Global CDN​

Through our partnership with Cloudflare, Bubble offers a network of servers strategically located worldwide to provide fast and reliable content delivery to users, no matter where they're based. By storing cached versions of static resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript, CDNs minimize the distance between the user and the app's original server.

Manage Bubble updates

Our shared server environments are continually updated with new features and security improvements. With the Enterprise plan, you decide when to update your server. This lets you test new features or changes in a controlled environment and roll them out on your own schedule.

Article section: [Updating the Bubble server](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/bubble-for-enterprise/hosting-and-infrastructure/using-dedicateupgrading-your-servers)​

Direct database access

Bubble offers read-only access to your PostgreSQL database. This feature paves the way for integrations with data warehousing and analytics tools such as Snowflake and BigQuery, enabling you to harness the full potential of your data.

Sub-apps

Create sub-apps with separate databases for separate end-users that operate completely independently and can be deployed to unique subdomains.

----
 Dedicated instance

Once your dedicated cluster is running. Your experience with Bubble will mostly be the same, except a few things:

New editor URL

The app editor will be hosted on a subdomain ([dXX.bubble.is](http://dXX.bubble.is)). The first time you'll visit this URL, you'll be prompted to login with your Bubble credentials or SSO. When you'll edit your app (from [bubble.io/home](http://bubble.io/home)), you'll be take directly to the right subdomain.

You can continue to manage your organization's account, provision members, update payment information, emails, and other settings through the [bubble.io](http://bubble.io) platform, just as you did prior to the upgrade.

**Note:** App modification date (for sorting apps in your home page) is either stored on the app object or in a Meta Thing. Since the app object cannot be read from a dedicated cluster, and the Meta thing is not updated when edits are made to a dedicated app, the app modification date is not reliably stored.

Upgrading your servers

With the Enterprise plan, you have the flexibility to control Bubble upgrades according to your own timeline. This lets you test your app to ensure compatibility before applying any updates.

Within the editor interface, you'll notice a fork icon at the top panel. By clicking on this icon, you can easily view your current installation version and check if an upgrade is available. If it is, information about the the latest version will be displayed, along with an "Upgrade" button. You can click this button to initiate the upgrade process and continue working on your project.

Simply refresh the page once the upgrade is complete.

**Note**: For those using dedicated servers, we **strongly** advise carrying out upgrades on a consistent basis. Performing a substantial upgrade after an extended period of time may lead to the simultaneous execution of numerous background calculations.

Typically, these calculations are distributed across various versions of the Bubble codebase and are staggered over time to avoid overwhelming the main cluster. Undertaking a large number of these calculations at once, due to a significant upgrade, has the potential to consume or even exceed the available resources on your dedicated instance temporarily.

Monitoring Dashboard

Once you are on the Enterprise plan, you will be able to monitor the health of your servers in the Logs Tab of the Editor. This will show you CPU utilization and memory usage. We will proactively notify you if your usage is reaching certain levels, and then we'll work with you to upgrade your infrastructure as needed.

 Single sign-on (SSO)

Bubble’s single sign-on (SSO) features are available on our [Enterprise plan](https://bubble.io/pricing). If you have questions or would like to discuss SSO for your organization, please [contact Sales](https://bubble.io/contact-sales).

What is SSO?

This article introduces some new terminology. You can find a table with definitions at the bottom of this document.

Article section: [SSO terminology](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/bubble-for-enterprise/security-and-compliance/single-sign-on-sssso-terminology)​

At its core, single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication service that allows a user to use one set of credentials (like a username and password) to access multiple applications. Think of it as having a master key that can open multiple doors in a building rather than juggling a bulky keyring.

Many companies use SSO to let users sign into a variety of third-party applications and services. For instance, when you log in to a new web service and are offered the option to "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with Facebook," you're seeing SSO in action.

SSO in enterprise work environments

Increasingly, the tools used by members of enterprise organizations are scattered across a large catalog of online services. For example, a company may use one piece of software for project management, and a different one for handling inventory and finances. Managing multiple login credentials for each tool isn't just inconvenient—it's a security concern. That's where SSO comes into play. With SSO, members of your organization only need one set of credentials to access all their apps.

SSO simplifies the login process and helps your team spend less time on password-related tasks and more time being productive. From a security standpoint, having one robust password means you're not juggling a myriad of potentially weak ones. From a managerial perspective, monitoring a single authentication point makes it easier to spot any IT issues.

This is why we offer a secure SSO solution that lets your members log into their Bubble account using widely adopted, secure identity providers. We’re compatible with any identity provider that's either SAML or OIDC, including (but not limited to) the following:

- ​[Auth0](https://workos.com/docs/integrations/auth0-saml)​
- ​[Azure AD](https://workos.com/docs/integrations/azure-ad-saml)​
- ​[Cloudflare](https://workos.com/docs/integrations/cloudflare-saml)​
- ​[Duo](https://workos.com/docs/integrations/duo-saml)​
- ​[Google](https://workos.com/docs/integrations/google-saml)​
- ​[JumpCloud](https://workos.com/docs/integrations/jumpcloud-saml)​
- ​[LastPass](https://workos.com/docs/integrations/lastpass-saml)​
- ​[Microsoft AD FS](https://workos.com/docs/integrations/microsoft-ad-fs-saml)​
- ​[Okta](https://workos.com/docs/integrations/okta-saml)​
- ​[OneLogin](https://workos.com/docs/integrations/onelogin-saml)​
- ​[Oracle](https://workos.com/docs/integrations/oracle-saml)​
- ​[PingFederate](https://workos.com/docs/integrations/pingfederate-saml)​
- ​[PingOne](https://workos.com/docs/integrations/pingone-saml)​
- ​[Salesforce](https://workos.com/docs/integrations/salesforce-saml)​
- ​[Shibboleth Generic](https://workos.com/docs/integrations/shibboleth-generic-saml)​
- ​[VMware](https://workos.com/docs/integrations/vmware-saml)​

A major advantage of this system is centralization. If a user changes their password or if their access permissions are updated, these changes are reflected across all applications linked to their credentials. It keeps things consistent and secure. With SSO, you're not just getting a streamlined login experience; you're investing in a secure and efficient operational future.

How SSO works

At its core, SSO is a way to manage user authentication across multiple SaaS applications and services. But what's happening under the hood to make this possible? Let’s first break down the step-by-step logic of SSO in action:

- **Initial authentication:** The process starts when a member logs into Bubble using SSO. This initial sign-in is verified by an identity provider (IdP) such as Auth0 and Okta, the trusty guardian of user identity. Think of the IdP as a gatekeeper, ensuring users are genuinely who they claim to be.
- **Token creation:** Once the IdP authenticates a user's credentials, it creates a special “token.” This token doesn't store sensitive data like passwords. Instead, it's like a “ticket” confirming that the user has been verified.
- **Use across apps:** As users move between different connected applications, this token is their passkey. Instead of knocking on the door of each new application with a separate password, the token shows they've already been vouched for. The apps trust the IdP's verification, allowing users straightforward access.

Setting up SSO on your organization’s Bubble account

If you’re interested in setting up SSO for your organization, please get in touch with our [Sales team](https://bubble.io/contact-sales), and we’ll provide you with the instructions to get the process started. After SSO has been enabled and set up, your organization admin can start inviting team members. For your first-time SSO login, use the link [bubble.io/login/sso](http://bubble.io/login/sso). If you have an existing Bubble account, you will be redirected to login via your existing login method to authenticate yourself. After logging in, you will be directed to migrate and consent to your new permissions in your organization. In every login thereafter, you would use the SSO login with your IdP.

Inviting members

Admins can easily add new members in bulk by entering user emails separated by commas. Each member will receive an email after they have been added, and will be redirected to [http://bubble.io/login/sso](http://bubble.io/login/sso) upon their next login.

Existing accounts

- If a member has an existing Bubble account, they will need to first authenticate themselves by logging in using their original method.
- If a member does not have a Bubble account, their account will be created for them automatically, using just-in-time (JIT) provisioning

After their first login, members will be required to use SSO to login to Bubble and will not be able to login via other authentication methods.

Removing members

Members can be removed by opening the dropdown contextual menu in the list of members and selecting Remove member.

![Image.png](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Arx-4r1qz8P58CAYXe_ULWVDk1QSyBqM4wxFJR2Gr4MV4QMUUTtiZrP460NJgXVbOvHTgcEgoZcPAxyk3WUbezEx6bvnnquhmkKiMY4KyOcZiB5mqMS5cZhLX6CBjCCokQTy0cl8Gy1DfAieI2W8rkU)

If you remove a member, they will be scheduled for deletion within seven days, with no ability to login via Bubble. However, you can reinstate their membership within this seven-day window if you’ve made a mistake.

Security restrictions for members

Members cannot transfer apps or change the permission settings in the Collaboration tab, unless they are the creator of that app. Members can create as many apps on the Free plan as needed, but only the admin can change the plan or buy plugins.

Logging in with SSO

All signed-out users will see the Log in with SSO option in the bottom corner of Bubble’s login form. Click this to be taken to the SSO form.

![Image.png](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/VR03syYVlUjLkkO5qbiEa35836yVIKS_WEgy54UoIKs_O3A5mJ848rE7Vfav3pwm7QmMsrERn57sMpvtFkNkvrO5YjSJI9oOi2351gGbjsDFAlDuGA7WSiNLtAIBH1NQf_QopdKTO3R_HmErACIK9-A)

The first step in the SSO process is to submit your email address. Bubble will automatically recognize which organization you belong to.

![Image.png](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OeZF70dv0IXpTcadiU33eAdISBhwsqS2iBapkB0B8GsSR66YbfJnUGO1v0GQySnzFyYTb2gis7uKDng9S2gTBnljEfoKm2Ts86lPpoZFx3DFfyaPGbDITc4Ib0vN7vsZXY9WUhMFlwxMbhBywPguBUQ)

You’ll then be taken to the sign-in form for the IdP that your organization uses.

![Image.png](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/i2FWRwwNzS5PI1u1RXPlf8fvHV3FGP6RHXLjQ7mQUXoMXS9jrtbQrnlJckFZ1Vog1161Lq2MW_W__fTniUGXVRsVK9DFg3G-JINJOlTull231R7olQoBpEqA2GuRmKezWbktuE5g8AbYuAo1vFJy6Es)

After signing in, you’ll be sent to the Bubble platform home screen, where you will see all your organization’s applications if you are an admin.

 GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation

**Legal disclaimer:** This article series is meant only to be educational content to help give you a start on these regulatory compliance matters and is strictly not intended to be legal advice. The information presented may not be applicable to your specific situation and may not reflect the most recent developments in this area.

Always consult a qualified legal professional for advice regarding specific regulatory compliance obligations relevant to your circumstances. Details about your speciﬁc idea, app or context could make a diﬀerence in how you approach these obligations.

Moreover, this article is meant to be an introductory- level guide and will not cover all the ﬁne details of these topics.

What is the GDPR?

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a data protection and privacy regulation established and enforced by the European Union (EU). Implemented in May 2018, the GDPR prescribes how individual’s personal data can be collected and used, including the options websites must offer users regarding their personal data. The GDPR was implemented in the United Kingdom after it left the EU.

GDPR represents a major milestone in tech regulation history, as it applies not only to companies based in the EU but also to companies with users in the EU. Given that many Bubble apps cater to a global audience, it's possible that your app may be subject to these regulations, even if your company and/or server are situated outside the EU.

GDPR applies to tech companies handling personal data in a commercial context. It requires websites to provide notice of personal data collection, usage, and sharing, establish a legal basis for data processing, and respect individual’s rights to access, portability, and deletion of their personal data, for example.

If you're interested in learning more about Bubble and GDPR, we recommend checking out our dedicated blog post that delves deeper into various aspects of GDPR regulations.

Blog post: [Bubble GDPR intro guide](https://bubble.io/blog/bubble-gdpr/)​

At the bottom of this page is a [GDPR terminology table](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/compliance/gdpgdpr-terminology).

Is Bubble GDPR compliant?

Bubble takes the protection of personal data seriously. We have implemented measures designed to meet the requirements of the GDPR (and other applicable data privacy laws).

However, this does not mean however that your app built on Bubble is automatically compliant. To use the GDPR terminology, you are likely a Data Controller for personal data on your app (and Bubble is a Data Processor and our processors are Sub-processors to you).

What this means is that the tools you use (including your Data Processors and Sub-processors) must comply with the GDPR (which is a big step toward your own compliance), but you still have to set up each individual app and documentation in the right way in order for it to be compliant with the GDPR.

> You can take advantage of Bubble’s capabilities to help meet your GDPR obligations.

Do I have to have a server in the EU to be compliant?

No, you do not necessarily have to use an EU-based server to host the personal data to be GDPR compliant. However, the GDPR imposes rules on transferring to or accessing personal data from outside the European Union. If your app processes personal data of EU residents and stores it on a non-EU server, you must ensure that the data transfer is in compliance with the GDPR.

Standard contractual clauses

Under the GDPR, transferring personal data from the EU to countries with lower data protection standards, including the US, is restricted. To overcome this, the EU has developed Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), which are pre-approved sets of contractual provisions designed to ensure that personal data transferred outside of the EU is adequately protected and meets the GDPR requirements.

> After the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that Privacy Shield was not a permissible transfer mechanism, Bubble incorporated the Standard Contractual Clauses into its DPAs.
When using SCCs, you agree to follow specific rules and principles regarding the processing and protection of personal data. This helps ensure that the personal data of EU residents is treated with the same level of care and protection as it would be within the EU.
As a Bubble developer, incorporating SCCs into your data processing agreements with your customers and service providers can be an essential step in becoming GDPR compliant. By doing so, you provide assurances that the personal data of your EU users is being handled securely and responsibly in compliance with the GDPR, regardless of where your server is located.
Bubble serves as a data processor for your company when you deploy your app and end-users sign up for an account on your app, which might be one of several processors you opt to use (an analytics platform like Google Analytics or payment gateway like Stripe are examples of other data processors you may choose to use). It’s important to note that even if Bubble and other processors you work with have made efforts to adhere to GDPR (such as Bubble entering into Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with its processors, who act as your sub-processors), you are still responsible for ensuring your Bubble app is GDPR-compliant.
Bubble has implemented the SCCs into its DPAs with its customers and its processors (your sub-processors). In addition, starting in July 2023, the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework and Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework, the third iteration of a joint EU-US and Swiss-US programs to enable personal data transfers from the EU and Switzerland to the US, became operational. As a participating company in the prior EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks, Bubble is “grandfathered”’ into the new EU-US and Swiss-US Data Privacy Frameworks and will apply the updated Data Privacy Framework Principles, but we will continue to use the SCCs in our DPAs as extra protection.
A frequent inquiry we receive at Bubble is along the lines of” “If you only implemented X, wouldn’t that make you GDPR-compliant?” An example of this is users asking if having an EU data center by itself would guarantee GDPR compliance for Bubble and Bubble apps.
Based on our understanding, the answer is no – merely storing data in an EU data center doesn’t meet all the necessary requirements for GDPR compliance. Similarly, subscribing to Bubble’s Enterprise plan and requesting your own EU-based dedicated Bubble servers is not enough to achieve full compliance with GDPR.

What must I do for my app to be compliant?

While the following list provides a suggested starting point for planning your app’s compliance, it shouldn’t be regarded as all-inclusive or specific to your app.

Ultimately, ensuring your app’s compliance is *your* responsibility as the developer, and you should seek the guidance of qualified legal counsel and other professionals to assist you in this process.

- **Understand the GDPR’s scope:** Determine if the GDPR applies to your app. If your app collects, stores, or processes personal data from EU residents, even if your company is located outside the EU, you must comply with the GDPR.
- **Establish a legal basis for processing data:** Ensure that your app has a legal basis for processing personal data, such as user consent, contract necessity, or a legitimate interest.
- **Provide notice and obtain consent:** Create a clear and transparent privacy notice, explaining what personal data your app collects, how it’s used, and with whom it’s shared. Where necessary, obtain explicit, affirmative consent from users before collecting their data. Ensure that users can easily withdraw their consent at any time.
- **Implement privacy by design:** Incorporate privacy considerations into your app’s design from the outset. Use privacy rules and conditions to protect user data and limit data collection to only what’s necessary.
- **Respect user rights:** Ensure that your app allows users to exercise their rights under the GDPR, including the right to: - access – rectify – erase – restrict processing – port … their personal data.
- **Set up data breach notifications:** Develop a process for detecting and reporting data breaches within no more than 72 hours to the relevant supervisory authority, as required by the GDPR.
- **Manage third-party relationships:** If your app uses plugins or third-party services (such as APIs or external databases) that process personal data, make sure they are GDPR compliant and enter into an appropriate DPAs with them.
- **Set up privacy rules:** Configure privacy rules in Bubble to restrict access to personal data (especially “sensitive” personal data to ensure users access the data they need to and are authorized to see. ’
- **Publish a privacy policy:** Draft and publish a comprehensive privacy policy that explains your app's data processing practices, user rights, and contact information for privacy-related inquiries.

 SOC 2 Type II

This section covers Bubble and SOC 2 compliance

**Legal disclaimer:** This article is meant only to be educational content to help give you a start on these regulatory compliance matters and is strictly not intended to be legal advice. The information presented may not be applicable to your specific situation and may not reflect the most recent developments in this area.

Always consult a qualified legal professional for advice regarding specific regulatory compliance obligations relevant to your circumstances. Details about your speciﬁc idea, app or context could make a diﬀerence in how you approach these obligations.

Moreover, this article is meant to be an introductory- level guide and will not cover all the ﬁne details of these topics.

Bubble has put in place a comprehensive and robust security program to protect all data, including personal data, on your app from a possible data breach or other problem. A description of our security program can be found at: [https://bubble.io/security](https://bubble.io/security). We also continually test our security to make sure it works as it’s supposed to.

What is SOC 2?

SOC 2, short for Service Organization Control 2, is a set of standards that companies follow to manage and secure customer data. It's like a rulebook for handling information, especially when it comes to using a trusted Software as a Service (SaaS) provider like Bubble.

SOC 2 audits and trust principles

SOC 2 reports are issued by independent auditors who assess the effectiveness of an organization's controls according to the criteria established by the [American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)](https://us.aicpa.org/forthepublic).

SOC 2 audits are made in two different ways, Type I and Type II, each serving a different purpose:

- **SOC 2 Type I:** This is like a snapshot of a company's systems and controls at a specific moment in time. It looks at how a company describes its controls and whether they are designed properly. Think of it as checking if all the locks in a house are in place. Type I is more about the planning and structure of the service than how it performs over time.
- **SOC 2 Type II:** This audit is more thorough. It's like checking those locks over a period of time (3 months in Bubble’s case) to see if they actually work, day in and day out. A Type II report doesn't just look at the design of the controls, but also how they operate over a defined period. It digs into the nitty-gritty and makes sure everything is working as it should be.

These audits ultimately lead to a report, which requires that Bubble adheres to at least one of the SOC 2's Trust Principles:

- security
- availability
- integrity
- confidentiality
- privacy

SOC 2 Type II report

Is Bubble SOC 2 compliant?

Yes. Specifically, Bubble is compliant with the SOC 2 Type II standard for security. Bubble has undergone a thorough external audit process by the independent auditor, [Sensiba LLP](https://sensiba.com/solutions/risk-assurance/soc/), and demonstrated that we have effective controls in place to ensure the security of our platform over time.

Looking ahead, we may consider extending our compliance to cover other Trust Principles.

Does that mean my Bubble app is also SOC 2 compliant?

Bubble's SOC 2 Type II report for security means that our platform itself meets the specific standards needed to be compliant. But when it comes to an individual app created using Bubble, the compliance doesn't automatically transfer over.

Think of Bubble like a set of tools in a workshop. We make sure the tools meet certain standards, but how someone uses those tools to build something is up to them. If a user wants their app to be SOC 2 compliant, they'll need to ensure that the way they design and operate the app meets the necessary trust principles and complete a separate audit.

What do I need to do to obtain a SOC 2 report?

Note: the following is a general guide for users looking to make their app compliant with SOC 2 standards while using Bubble. This is not legal or professional compliance advice, and the specific requirements can vary widely depending on factors like your industry, region, or the particular needs of your end users. It's always a good idea to consult a legal or secuity professional who understands your unique situation to ensure that you're meeting all the necessary requirements.

With that said, here's a general overview that might help you get started on your path to compliance.

- **Understand the requirements:** First, figure out what compliance standards you need to meet. SOC 2 has specific trust principles, so understanding what they require will be your starting point. You may want to obtain a report in one or more of the trust principles.
- **Assess your app:** Look at your app and identify where you might be handling sensitive information or where particular security measures need to be in place. Think of this like spotting the weak links in a chain.
- **Implement controls:** Put measures in place to ensure that your app meets security standards. This might involve things like setting up privacy rules and server-side conditions to ensure data remains protected.
- **Documentation:** Keep records of what you're doing to meet security standards. This is essential if you need to prove compliance later.
- **Regular monitoring and testing:** Compliance isn't a one-time thing; you'll need to keep an eye on things and make sure your controls are working as they should be.
- **Consider professional assistance:** Depending on your needs and the complexity of your app, you might want to consider hiring a professional who specializes in compliance. They can help you navigate specific requirements and make sure you're on the right track.
- **Consider Bubble security assistance platforms:** Organizations like Flusk and ncScale can assist by checking for data leaks and safe authentication protocols, performing penetration tests, detecting inefficiencies, monitoring error logs, mapping dependencies, minimizing exposure, and more.
- **Stay informed:** Compliance standards can change, so it's essential to keep up to date with the latest requirements

 Design tab

This is the short-form core reference entry for the design tab where we cover the technical details of the interface. For a more in-depth article, see the link below:

Article: [The design tab](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/navigating-the-bubble-editor/tabs-and-sections/design-tab)​

This is where you design the visual appearance of the app. Draw elements on the page, drag and resize them, and adjust their properties and appearance.

Adding elements

To add a new element, click an element type in the palette on the left, then click and drag on the page to insert it. Double-clicking on an element reveals the Property Editor, where you can customize the element's appearance and behavior. Right-clicking on an element displays a drop-down menu with additional editing options.

UI Builder

The UI Builder is where you can add new elements to the page and modify any existing elements. Bubble pages are by default a "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) editing experience - whatever you create in this tab is generally what an end-user of your app will see. Containers and Visual elements also have layout settings, which control a page or element's responsive behavior. When designing responsive pages, your page's layout will scale gracefully as the end user's screen gets larger or smaller.

Opening the property editor for an element

Double-clicking on an element reveals the Property Editor, where you can customize the element's appearance and behavior. Right-clicking on an element displays a drop-down menu with additional editing options.

This is also true for the page itself.

Elements Tree

The elements tree shows all the elements that currently exist on the page. Indentation signifies a parent/child relationship between a container and the contents of that container - remember that there can be multiple levels of nesting (e.g. groups within groups within ...)

Drag and drop

The elements tree also allows you to re-order and re-parent elements on the page by dragging and dropping items where you want them. Elements inside a group are ordered differently depending on the container layout type selected (more below).

Behavior

- Clicking and holding an element will allow you to drag, and a line will appear to indicate where you will be dropping your element.
- Groups will highlight when hovered to indicate that you are dropping within that group.
- If you hover over a collapsed group for more than one second, it will expand automatically.
   - If you drag into a collapsed group, the element will default to be the last child in the list
- Elements can be re-ordered within a parent container.
   - Fixed and Align to Parent containers sort their children by ascending z-index. Reordering within a Fixed or Align to Parent will change z-index.
   - Row and Column containers sort their children by ascending order. Reordering within a Row or Column will change the order of an element.
- Elements can be moved from one parent container to another.
   - Into Fixed: The element that is dropped in will respect z-index and default to top left position.
   - Into Align to Parent: The element that is dropped will respect z index and default to top left position.
   - Into Row: The element that is dropped will respect the existing order.
   - Into Column: The element that is dropped will respect the existing respect order.
- Draggable elements include containers nested within a parent container.

Limitations

- We have disabled drag and drop for popups, group foci, and floating groups, as they rest above the page and cannot be nested into other groups. You can, however, drag other elements into these containers.
- You may not drag a group into itself.

Element palette

Below the elements tree is the palette of all elements that you have access to for building your app. Bubble comes with many built-in element choices; you can also gain access to new elements via plugins.

The element palette is divided into a couple of sections for organization. Visual elements are ones that generally simply display something on the page. Container elements are elements that can contain other elements, including other containers. Input form elements generally allow the end-user to provide some kind of input, whether it be text, files, or something else.

Below that is the section of reusable elements available in the app. And at the bottom is a section of two special element templates: tab element and signup login form, which are two common user interfaces that might be helpful in your app.

Adding elements

To add a new element:

- click an element type in the palette on the left
- click and drag on the page to insert it

Element Inspector

This slidable inspector shows a view of how the selected element is used on the page. Since an element can be used in many different places, such as in events, actions, or other elements, this centralized view is helpful.

The Element Inspector shows the element's custom states and allows you to modify, delete, and add a new state. The element's events and actions are also shown along with the other page elements referring to the current element.

Clicking on an entry takes you to the appropriate place in the Bubble Editor.

Responsive

You can switch the Design tab from UI Builder mode to the Responsive sub-tab. Responsive settings refer to the configuration of how the page is displayed on varying screen widths - how the layout 'responds' to changing widths. As such, the Responsive tab allows you to quickly get a sense of how your page layout will respond depending on the screen size without previewing it live.

At the top of the left flyout of this sub-tab, there are shortcuts to snap the page width to different common screen widths, e.g. mobile portrait, mobile landscape, tablet and laptop. You can also change the page width to any arbitrary width using the ruler at the top.

**Responsive Breakpoints**

Your Bubble app comes with a Default breakpoint, four preset breakpoints, and the ability to add custom breakpoints. The Default breakpoint is equal to the Default builder width value that is set for that page.

The four presets are:

- Mobile (320 px)
- Mobile Landscape (768 px)
- Tablet (992 px)
- Desktop (1200 px)

You can use any of your app’s breakpoints to test the page behavior on the Responsive Viewer tab and as data sources to set “Current page width” conditionals on any element.

**Creating a new custom breakpoint**

You can create a new custom breakpoint by clicking “Add custom” within the breakpoints dropdown.

**Editing breakpoints**

You can edit any breakpoint on the toolbar or in the breakpoints dropdown.

Editing a custom breakpoint will edit the data source and update the breakpoint wherever it is referenced in the app.

Editing a preset breakpoint will create a new custom breakpoint and update any reference of the breakpoint to the new custom breakpoint.

eg. Changing the preset breakpoint Mobile from 320 px to 325 px will result in the creation of a custom breakpoint named Mobile (Custom) (325 px) and all references to Mobile will now reference Mobile (Custom) (325 px).

**Removing and deleting breakpoints**

You can remove any breakpoint from the toolbar, but this does not delete it as an available data source.

You can delete any breakpoint from the breakpoints dropdown. Deleting a breakpoint from the dropdown will remove it from any pages that are using it. This will in turn unlink it from any referenced conditionals and flag an issue in the issue checker to fix those conditionals.

 Design tab (Legacy)

This is where you design the visual appearance of the app. Draw elements on the page, drag and resize them, and adjust their properties and appearance. For new users, we recommend starting here. To add a new element, click an element type in the Palette on the left, then click and drag on the page to insert it. Double-clicking on an element reveals the Property Editor, where you can customize the element's appearance and behavior. Right-clicking on an element displays a drop-down menu with additional editing options.

For more information to get started, see the "Building a user interface" guide.

UI Builder

The UI Builder subtab is where you can add new elements to the page and modify any existing elements. Bubble is generally a "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) editing experience - whatever you create in this tab is generally what an end-user of your app will see, though there are many features to help you design your app exactly how you want it.

Your app can have multiple pages, and in fact comes by default with a few pages: the 404 page which end-users see if they visit a URL on your app that doesn't exist, and the reset_pw page which end-users use to reset their passwords. You can create new pages or switch to editing other pages (or reusable elements) via the dropdown in the upper left, in the top bar.

Elements Tree

The elements tree shows all the elements that currently exist on the page. Indentation signifies a relationship between a container and the contents of that container - remember that there can be multiple levels of nesting (e.g. groups within groups within ...).

The top-down ordering of the elements tree corresponds to the vertical positioning of elements on the page (note: not the z-ordering). Greyed out items in the list are currently hidden; you can click on these in the elements tree to make them visible and select them.

Element palette

Below the elements tree is the palette of all elements that you have access to for building your app. Bubble comes with many built-in element choices; you can also gain access to new elements via plugins.

The element palette is divided into a couple of sections for organization. Visual elements are ones that generally simply display something on the page. Container elements are elements that can contain other elements, including other containers. Input form elements generally allow the end-user to provide some kind of input, whether it be text, files, or something else.

Below that is the section of reusable elements available in the app. And at the bottom is a section of two special element templates: tab element and signup login form, which are two common user interfaces that might be helpful in your app.

Element Inspector

This slidable inspector shows a view of how the selected element is used on the page. Since an element can be used in many different places, such as in events, actions, or other elements, this centralized view is helpful. The Element Inspector shows the element's custom states and allows you to modify, delete, and add a new state. The element's events and actions are also shown along with the other page elements referring to the current element. Clicking on an entry takes you to the appropriate place in the Bubble Editor.

Responsive

You can switch the Design tab to the Responsive sub-tab. This is where you control the responsive settings of the page and all the elements within. Responsive settings refer to the configuration of how the page is displayed on varying screen widths - how the layout 'responds' to changing widths.

At the top of the left flyout of this sub-tab, there are shortcuts to snap the page width to different common screen widths, e.g. mobile portrait, mobile landscape, tablet and laptop. You can also change the page width to any arbitrary width using the ruler at the top.

----
 Workflow tab

This is the section where you map out the app's reactions to user interactions. Whether it's a click, text entry, or login/logout event, you design a sequence of responses tailored to each user action.

These responses can range from data alterations and external communications, like emails or service calls, to visual changes on the page.

In the *Core reference* box below we link to all the available *events* and *actions*. If you are new to using the workflow tab, you may find the user manual articles and video lessons below a useful starting point.

 Data tab

This is the short-form core reference entry for the data tab where we cover the technical details of the interface. For a more in-depth article, see the link below:

Article: [The data tab](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/navigating-the-bubble-editor/tabs-and-sections/data-tab)​

The Data Tab manages the data that users create when using the app. It is where you configure and see the data within your app's database. It consists of a number of sub-tabs.

Data types

This section is where you define the data types that your app has - the kinds of things that you want to store data about in your database. The list of existing data types is listed on the left, along with a place to create a new data type.

When a data type is selected, its fields are shown on the right side, along with the ability to create a new field on that data type.

Note that the structure of an app's data types is visible in your app's JavaScript code files. This includes:

- data type names
- field names
- default values

Don't include any sensitive information in these fields. You can read more about how to maintain your app's security and privacy in the user manual article series below:

User manual article series: [Security](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/security)​

Make this data type private

When creating a new data type, you have the option to make it private or public. If the data type is made private, it will be created with a privacy rule that allows only a thing's creator to view all fields, find the thing in searches and view attached files, with the "Everybody else" permission set to nothing allowed.

If instead the data type is created as public, things of the type will be visible by everyone.

User manual article: [Protecting data with privacy rules](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/protecting-data-with-privacy-rules)​

Privacy

This sub-tab is where you define rules around which users can see different kinds of data, or under which situations a user can see the data. Privacy rules are very important for the data privacy of your app! By default, new data types are generally visible to all end-users, so it's important to set privacy rules before you begin handling real end-user data.

User manual article: [Protecting data with privacy rules](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/protecting-data-with-privacy-rules)​

App data

This section shows you the data in your app's database. You view the data by data type, and you can create custom views of a data type to show a specific set of fields as columns, a filtered subset of data, sorted data, etc.

Note that the development and live versions of your app have separate databases, so you need to switch between them in the upper right in order to see the respective data. You can also create, modify or delete specific things (rows) in the database, or do bulk upload, export or modify actions.

User manual article: [The data tab](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/navigating-the-bubble-editor/tabs-and-sections/data-tab) User manual article: [Data](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data)​

Run as

When looking at the user table, clicking the button 'Run as' runs the app as if you were that user, which makes debugging particular cases much easier.

Warning: Until you logout, you are using the app as this user, so do not make modifications.

User manual article section: [Run your app as a specific user](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/navigating-the-bubble-editor/previewing-your-aprun-as-a-specific-user)​

New view

Clicking this button displays a popup that creates a new database view, which defines the fields that are seen on the right side of the screen. Constraints can be added to create a smaller list. By default, each type has a view that shows most fields with no constraints. The number of views is unlimited, and these views are shared between the Live and Development versions.

Duplicate views

Click the "Copy" icon next to the name of an existing database view to create another view just like it. You can then modify and add additional constraints to the duplicate.

Search

Enter something into the input box, and the things in the current view that contain the entered text are listed. Use this for a quick search of the app data.

New entry

Clicking this button displays a popup where you create a new database entry. Choose the type of thing and enter information into the predefined fields. This is equivalent to using a 'Create a new thing' action in a workflow.

**Note:** If you are uploading a file directly in App Data when creating or modifying an entry, there is a maximum file size of 50 MB. You can use the file uploader element instead to upload files up to 5 GB, although most browsers have an unofficial limit of 2 GB. Bigger uploads than this may be unreliable.

Upload

Clicking this button displays a popup where you upload a comma-separated CSV file of data. The type of data and relevant fields should be defined in the app before importing the file. This feature is available to users with a paid Bubble plan. Select the type of data and file to upload. Map the columns from the file to the fields of the data type and then validate and upload the data.

Important: The first row of your CSV file must be a header row containing the names of the fields for the data. Here's [a sample file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/f1454094816983x291920213727280500/normalfile.csv) for reference.

Modify

You can bulk-modify data via a CSV upload. To do so, you should have a file with a column containing the unique ID of the things you want to modify, and enter the values that should be modified in subsequent columns.

Export

This button generates a CSV file with the data of the current view. The file is exported to the Download folder of your browser. This file can be edited. Because the app owner performs this operation, no privacy rules apply, and all fields chosen in the current view are exported. This feature is available to users with a paid Bubble plan.

Bulk Action

Clicking this button displays a popup that runs an API workflow on the entries in the current view. This is useful when you want to modify a list of things in the database. Select the API workflow you want to run. The workflow takes only a thing as a parameter.

Warning: This operation permanently modifies the data. If processing many entries, this may take some time.

Switch to Live/Switch to Dev.

Clicking this displays the Version dropdown menu to switch between the Development and Live versions of the app. Remember that each version has a separate database.

Copy and restore database

Clicking this button opens a popup to overwrite the Live version of the data with the Development version, and vice and versa. Use this to test the app with real data or migrate the Development version data to the Live mode. For users with a paid Bubble plan, the application database can be restored to an earlier point in time. The restore functionality is designed to recover from mistakes that corrupt or delete big chunks of data. It restores the complete state of the database, including all the users' account information, a list of images, scheduled workflow runs, etc.

Warning: Any data created after the restored version will be deleted. This option should be used only in catastrophic situations where it is better to revert to a previous database than to work with the current database. Restore operations are reversible. Simply perform another restore to the point in time right before the first restore.

Wiping the database change history

You can delete the database change history of each individual database (Development/Live) by using the *wipe database change history* feature in the *Copy and restore database* popup.

Erasing the change history is **irreversible** and **permanently deletes the database backups**. Exercise caution when using this feature. Unless you fully understand the consequences and have a clear reason to use it, we advice you to not go through with it.

You can read more about what this does, and its advantages and drawbacks in the user manual article below:

Article: [Wiping the database change history](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/maintaining-an-application/database-maintenance/wiping-change-history)​

User manual article: [Restoring backups](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/maintaining-an-application/database-maintenance/database-backups)​

Primary fields

Clicking this button opens a popup where you define the primary field for each of the data types. This determines the way the data is displayed and how the CSV files are generated. For example, a user may be represented by his email, an apartment, an address, etc. This is for display purposes only.

Refresh data

Refresh to view recent changes to your data, especially as the result of a backend workflow or database trigger event.

Load 50 more items

Click here to display an additional 50 rows in this database view.

Upload data as a CSV

This popup uploads existing data from a CSV file. CSV is a standard way to represent rows and columns of data in a text format. Microsoft Excel, for example, generates these files. This feature is available to users with a paid Bubble plan.

Note: This feature is now in public Beta and some limitations may exist.

For example, there is a minor inconsistency in formatting between how Bubble exports a list`"x , y , z"`and the list format it requires on import`"[x , y , z]"`.

Type of data

Select which type of data to upload. The type of data and relevant fields should be defined in the app before importing the file.

Data delimiter

Commas are typically used to delimit entries, but different delimiters are possible. Tab or pipe delimiters are useful when working with text that includes commas. Choose the delimiter in the application creating the CSV file.

Pick a file to upload

Select a CSV file to upload.

Map fields

This very important step is where you map the columns of data to the fields in the application database.

Custom field

Select a data type field in the dropdown menu for each column of data. These fields should be defined in the data type before the upload.

Composite field

If the field you're matching the column with is a custom type, then specify which field of the subtype should be used to match the text entry. For example, let's say you're uploading a list of apartments, and one of the fields is an owner. If the owner is represented by a last name in the CSV file, choose 'Last name' as the composite field. The entries should exist in the database before you upload the file. If two entries in the Bubble application database match the same value, an error will be returned.

List delimiter

This is the delimiter to use when a field is a list of things. It should be different from the main delimiter. For example, if ';' is used as the delimiter, the data should be in this form: 12;54;32;67.

Note: When importing data for type list, optionally enclose the list in '[' and ']', and then separate the individual items with the delimiter. For example, "[kitchen; bedroom; bathroom]", or "kitchen; bedroom; bathroom".

Overwrite data when the field value is empty

When unchecked, empty entries in your CSV for a field will be ignored. When checked, instead they will explicitly overwrite the existing value with an empty value. In both cases, unmapped fields are ignored and will not be overwritten.

Validate data

Clicking this button does a quick analysis of the data to be uploaded, to make sure the first couple of rows are valid.

Upload data

Clicking this button uploads the data. First, it uploads the file to our servers. Then, it processes the upload in the background using your server capacity. While this happens, you are free to close the webpage and come back. An email will be sent on completion, or if there is an error while uploading.

Note: Only one upload or modify can occur at a time for a given application.

Option sets

Option sets are lists of a given set of options that are defined by you for use throughout your app. Examples would include things like a pre-defined list of statuses that tasks can go through, a list of all countries in the world, types of user privilege levels, etc. Unlike data, the options in an option set cannot be added to, deleted or modified by an end-user - they are defined as part of the app. This sub-tab is where you manage your option sets: which sets exist, the specific options in a set, and any additional attributes you've created on a set.

User manual article: [Option sets](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/static-data/option-sets)​

File manager

The File Manager section in the Data Tab shows the files or images that you or your users have uploaded in either the development or live version of your application. These are stored separately from the defined data types or option sets, and you can manage them here.

**Note:** Apps on free plans do not have the ability to upload `.html` file types. If you need to upload an `.html file` type for your app's use case, consider upgrading to a Paid plan.

File name

The name of this file when it was uploaded to your application. Enter a name to search for a specific file.

Only private files

If this box is checked, only files attached to a data type, and therefore controlled by that type's privacy rules, will appear in your list of files.

File type

Limit the displayed files based on type, for example, show only jpegs, pngs, or PDFs.

Sort by

Choose whether to sort by file size or created date, and check the "Descending" box to largest to smallest files, or most to least recent.

Search

Click this button to apply your search constraints for file name, private files, file type, and sort by field.

Size

The size of the uploaded file in bytes.

Type

The format of the uploaded file, such as csv, css, jpeg, png, pdf, or ttf.

Uploaded date

The time at which the file was uploaded.

User ID

The unique ID of the user who uploaded the file.

Attached to

For private files, the unique ID of the thing this file is attached to.

View

Click this link to preview the uploaded file. When you click this from the File Manager, you have admin access and will also be able to view private files.

 Styles tab

The Styles Tab manages collections of visual and layout properties that are shared across elements in the app. Styles make it easy to maintain and modify a consistent visual identity.

Rather than setting the font, background, and border for each element, define a style and apply it to all the elements of a given type.

Style and font variables

Bubble also includes pre-defined font and color variables in the Style variables sub tab to help make designing your application even faster. When the value of a Style variable is updated, any instance that uses the color variable will receive the new value automatically.

 Styles tab (Legacy)

The Styles Tab manages collections of visual and layout properties that are shared across elements in the app. Styles make it easy to maintain and modify a consistent visual identity. Rather than setting the font, background, and border for each element, define a style and apply it to all the elements of a given type. Bubble includes some built-in themes to help you get started. Use these to completely restyle the app. We integrate some popular themes from across the web, such as Bootstrap and Material Design.

For more information to get started, see the "Using Styles" article.

----
 Plugins tab

The Plugins Tab extends the functionality of Bubble by installing and configuring plugins. Plugins add additional elements, events, actions, and data sources. These plugins are created by the Bubble Team and other Bubble users, and there are both free and paid plugins. Most external services connecting to the app, including payment providers such as Stripe, analytics providers such as Mixpanel and Google Analytics, and social networks such as Facebook, are packaged as plugins.

You can see the gallery of available plugins with the "+ Add plugins" button. Any plugins already installed in the app are shown in the left column of this sub-tab. Clicking on a particular installed plugin will show any configuration settings of that plugin in the right section, along with an opportunity for you to leave a rating of that plugin for others in the marketplace to see.

For more information to get started, see the "Using plugins" guide.

Installed plugins

Plugin versions

Many plugins will be updated over time by their creators. If you have a plugin installed in your app, new versions of that plugin do not immediately take effect for your app; this is because new versions might have changes that would break older functionality that your app may rely on. Instead, you will see the option to change the version of the plugin in the Plugins tab, on the details of that particular plugin. This allows you to change to a different version in development mode, assess and fix any issues caused by the update as needed, and then deploy to live. Note that similarly, you can also choose to move to an older version of the plugin, though there is no guarantee the older version will be available to revert to forever.

Add plugins

Clicking this button will open the plugin marketplace, where you can browse, install and subscribe to plugins in the Bubble ecosystem.

Types

Plugins can extend various functionality of your Bubble app; these varying kinds of functionality are categorized in the "Types" filter. For example, "Action" refers to plugins that add new workflow action choices, while "Login service" is where you'd find plugins that let your end-users log in with an external website (e.g. "log in with Facebook"). A plugin can be categorized under varying types.

Categories

Categories are different use cases and themes that plugins are categorized by. The plugin author self-selects which category/ies to be listed under.

Pricing

The Bubble ecosystem has free as well as paid ("premium") plugins. For paid plugins, sometimes you will have the choice of paying a one-time price, or subscribing to the plugin for a monthly recurring price. Remember that plugins are installed and purchased on a per-app basis.

Built by

We at Bubble have created a number of plugins to provide useful functionality to apps. Our ecosystem of Bubble users and developers have created even more plugins to help you!

Practically speaking, if you find a bug with a Bubble-built plugin, the Bubble team will triage and respond to you about it. If you find a bug with an ecosystem-built plugin, you should reach out to the plugin's creator with information about the bug.

Sorting

The plugin gallery can be sorted by a number of different dimensions to help you more easily find plugins. You can sort by the plugin's name, usage  of apps it's installed on), rating, publishing date, or price.

----
 Settings tab

The Settings Tab is where you perform administrative tasks. For example, controlling who can edit the app, setting app-wide appearance settings, such as a color palette or an icon, configuring the domain name, managing languages and translations, controlling SEO behavior, and configuring the API. There are a number of sub-tabs with controls over different aspects of the app.

For further detail about each setting, see the "Application settings" guide.

App plan

This is where you see which Bubble app plan your current app is on. Remember that Bubble plans generally apply at the app, not the user, level. In this sub-tab, you can see some of the capabilities of your current plan and change your plan as desired.

Billing information

On the App Plan tab, you'll see information about which credit card is on file for your Bubble account; this is the payment method that will be charged for any changes. You will also see information about any active coupons / discounts on your account.

Paid plugins

The App Plan tab will also show you information about paid plugins that are attached to this app. Remember that plugins are purchased on a per-app basis.

General

This sub-tab contains a mix of different settings - some design-oriented, some privacy-oriented, some app-level management oriented. Of particular note is that here is where you input Google API keys to allow geolocation and maps to work in your app.

Google API keys

See [this article](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/working-with-data/working-with-location-data) on how to set up your Google Maps and Geocode API Keys.

Do not send an email when the application is being rate-limited for map loads

If you have your Google keys set up, your app will use those keys when making requests from Google Maps and Geocode. Google rate-limits these requests, and by default, you (the app creator) will receive an email from us when the application is being rate-limited. Checking this box will disable that email.

Algolia

See [this article](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/working-with-data/using-algolia) on how to set up the integration between your app and Algolia.

Prevent clipping fields on rows too large to fit in Algolia (advanced)

Algolia has a default size limit for data fields that are sent to it. Bubble implements clipping correspondingly to help Bubble apps stay under that default size limit. However, advanced users may not want Bubble to do this for various reasons, and can use this setting to control that.

Optimize application

[](https://youtu.be/efni1kbObqs)

Watch this video to learn more about the Optimize App setting

Over time, as many changes are made to your Bubble app, the application will remember information about parts of it that may no longer be relevant (e.g. a style that used to exist but no longer, or a data type that used to exist but has since been deleted).

This tool in the General tab will help you clean some of that unused content out, which could improve performance of your app overall. Note that doing so will prevent you from certain actions, such as restoring a deleted data type, if you've cleared out the history of that deleted data type.

Clean app changes history

Similar to "Optimize application", this feature clears the saved history of changes to your app. If you're sure you no longer want this history (which powers features like reverting your app to a past point in time), you can clear it to improve app performance.

Export application

Bubble apps can be exported as a JSON file - please see [this article](https://manual.bubble.io/new-start-here/application-and-data-ownershiexporting-your-application-and-data).

Import application

If you have the JSON of a Bubble app (e.g. from exporting a Bubble app, see above), you can import it into the current app with this feature.

Domain / email

This sub-tab is where you control your app's custom domain. By default, apps come with a URL like [myappname.bubbleapps.io](http://myappname.bubbleapps.io), but if you've bought a domain that you want to use, like [myappname.com](http://myappname.com), you can connect it to your app here. Along with that, you can also configure settings so that your app can send out emails at greater scale.

Languages

This sub-tab contains Bubble's feature to help you localize your app to different languages. Here, you see different "app texts" - snippets of text that appear throughout your app, some of which are built-in, others from plugins, and still others that you define. For any of these snippets, you have the opportunity to provide the translation of that snippet into any other language that Bubble supports out of our catalog of several dozen.

User manual article: [Translating your app](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/static-data/app-texts-translations)​

Import and export

To facilitate changing many App Texts at once, you can import and export all the App Texts from one or more languages as a CSV. If you are planning to import, we recommend you first do an export to get the expected structure of the CSV file for the import.

User manual article: [Translating your app](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/static-data/app-texts-translations)​

SEO / metatags

Bubble has various features to help you improve the SEO ranking of your app. Although the content of your app is probably the most important factor in SEO ranking, there are a variety of technical requirements for SEO that Bubble can help with, many of which live in this sub-tab.

On the subject of SEO we have an in-depth article series that covers both the general concepts of how SEO works and how to set it up in Bubble.

Article series: [SEO in Bubble](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/maintaining-an-application/seo)​

Hosting files in the root directory

With this feature, you can upload a file and specify a file name, and Bubble will begin exposing that particular file at [yourappdomain].com/[filename]. This is necessary to accomplish certain things (e.g. to prove ownership of your domain for various other web services) and can also just provide convenient access to certain key files for your app or business.

No two files should have the same name. Also note that you must deploy your app for newly hosted files in your development version to also appear in your live version.

API

APIs is a broad subject, and for new users it can be one of the more complex areas of Bubble to learn. Still, it's also one of Bubble's most powerful and exciting features that open up your app to work together with other systems all over the web.

The article series below takes you through what APIs are, the different types of APIs and how to set it all up in Bubble.

Article series: [APIs](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api)​

Bubble apps come with APIs, which allow your app to connect with other web services. This sub-tab is where you turn the app's APIs on or off, as well as control what's available through the APIs.

Generate a new API token

Once you've turned on at least one of your app's APIs, you have the option to generate a new API token. This is one of the ways a call to the API can be authenticated. See the [API reference](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/introductioauthentication).

**Tip:** You have access to this option when you are an admin of the app's current version (e.g. Development or Live).

**Caution:** Using the API token feature allows for a lot of flexibility with inbound API connections, but it also opens up for potential security vulnerabilites as it gives the broadest possible access to your app's API.

If you are not entirely sure of the implications of this, we recommend reading the guide below to learn more about how the different authentication methods affect your app's security.

Article series: [API authentication](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/authentication)​

API token label & private key

For each API token you choose to create, you are able to supply a custom label for it, which makes it easier for you to remember where each token is used, for example. Regardless, you will also see the private key itself.

Collaboration

On certain higher app plans, you can invite other Bubble users to collaborate with you on your app. This is where you can control who your collaborators are and what privileges they have on the app.

User manual article: [Collaboration in Bubble](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/maintaining-an-application/collaboration) Core reference: [List of collaboration settings](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/application-settings/collaboration)​

Sub apps

This is an advanced feature that lets you connect one app with another in a parent-child relationship, and changes to the parent can be 'pushed' to the child.

User manual article: [Sub-apps](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/sub-apps)​

Copy DB for creation

When you first create a sub app, you have the option of copying the parent app's database to the sub app with this checkbox.

Push to sub applications

This section lets you push changes from a parent app to its sub apps. Please refer to [this article](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/customizing-an-application/sub-apps) to understand what does vs does not get pushed.

Versions

Bubble generally rolls out updates to the platform many times a day and there is no need for you to do anything in order to receive those updates. However, on rare occasions, an update might introduce a "breaking change" that could alter your app's current functionality.

For these specific changes, you'll need to actively upgrade your Bubble version, which can be done within this section.

Applications on the Enterprise plan have a greater degree of control over when updates are applied to their app. You can read more about it in our articles series about Bubble for Enterprise.

The Logs Tab monitors activity when users interact with the app. It shows the overall usage statistics, allowing you to keep an eye on your plan limits. It also allows to you view individual server-side workflow runs, so you can see when users modify data or take other server actions, such as sending an email. Finally, you can view and manually cancel scheduled future workflow runs.

This sub-tab shows you various data around your app's capacity usage. In other words, it shows the general activity of users on your app and the computing resources used by your app. If you suspect that your app is slower than expected because you are capacity-constrained (since each app plan comes with a certain level of capacity), this is where you can investigate that.

Server capacity usage and real time metrics

This section of the page shows you various metrics around your app's capacity. See [article](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/optimizing-an-application/performance-and-scalincapacity).

**Email preferences**

By default, Bubble will send you certain emails when we detect that capacity has hit certain thresholds. One option you have is "Do not send daily emails when the application hits its maximum capacity usage over the previous 24 hours" - this will suppress the corresponding email.

In addition, you can choose to "Only send emails when the maxed-out period exceeds this duration (minutes)".

Server capacity usage details

This section of the page shows you a breakdown of what parts of your app are using capacity in a given time period. Note that you can click on sections of the chart to go into deeper levels of detail. Also note that the chart represents the % breakdown of what capacity was used on - so the chart will total 100% in periods of high and low capacity usage.

Workflow runs history and storage

This section shows summary stats on how many workflows have run this month as well as how much file storage your app is using.

For workflow runs, note that the number does not include workflows that have run solely on the end-user's browser (on the client).

Page load metrics

This section shows various metrics relating to pages of your app being loaded, including data that shows how much data is being loaded on those pages.

These charts show metrics about your pages loading time. This data is gathered over the latest page loads by all your users over the last 60 minutes.

**Metric to display**

You can see three different kind of metrics: – **Page load duration: render complete** The time in milliseconds from when the Bubble server first receives a request for a page, to when all elements on the page are finished rendering. This includes the time it takes for the server to process the request, latency between the server and the web browser, the time it takes to load all client-side javascript and css, and the time it takes the browser to draw the elements on the page. – **Page load duration: data loaded:** The time in milliseconds from when the Bubble server first receives a request for a page, to when all the elements on the page are rendered, and all the dynamic data required by above-the-fold elements is fetched and displayed. This is equivalent to the "Page Loaded Above Fold" data source. It includes all the time included "Page load duration: render complete", plus the time to load data (such as Repeating Groups lists). – **Page load: count of data items required:** This is the number of data Things loaded during the period tracked by the "Page load duration: data loaded" metric. It's an estimate of the total data the page requires in order for all the above-fold elements to finish loading. It's useful for investigating the impact that loading data (for instance, in Repeating Groups) is having on page load times.

**Percentile (%)**

You can choose to show averages over the best X percents. The best 1% will show the best performance, while 99% will show all situations.

Server logs

The Server Logs section in the Logs Tab allows searches of the log of server-side actions, such as send email or change data, executed when users interacted with the app. Search for a particular user by email or ID, within certain dates, or specific keywords. Scroll down to automatically load older events in the results view.

Basic filtering

You can filter your application's logs with the following options:

- From date - Choose the earliest date for which you want to see events. Searches start at midnight of that day. If empty, the search continues until the day the app was created. Results are currently limited to the previous two weeks.
- To date - Choose the latest date for which you want to see events. Searches end at 11:59 pm of that day. If empty, the current date is used.
- User - Filter actions by a specific user by typing in the user's email or unique ID. If this field is empty, the data for all users is returned.
- Contains - Enter some text to search for. For example, to search for the word: mountain, type: mountain, without quotes. To search for the exact phrase: tallest mountain, type: tallest mountain with single quotes, 'tallest mountain.' To search for log entries containing either: tall or mountain, type: tall OR mountain, without quotes. OR must be in all caps. If this field is empty, all log entries are returned.

Advanced filtering

Click "Show advanced" to toggle additional search criteria, such as:

- Started running workflow - This marks the beginning of a workflow executing
- Event condition passed - The event condition evaluated to true (or wasn't set), so Bubble is going to run the workflow
- Event condition not passed - The event condition evaluated to false, so Bubble is going to end the workflow
- Running action - Bubble is beginning to run a specific workflow action
- Action condition failed - Bubble is ending the execution of a workflow action because the condition evaluation to false
- Workflow error - The workflow stopped running because of an error
- Autobinding operation - A user modified data by editing an input that uses autobinding
- Plugin server side output - A server-side plugin action ran; this is the raw output, for use in debugging
- Plugin server side error - A server-side plugin action failed with an error; this is the error, for use in debugging
- Scheduled task to run - Bubble scheduled a task to be executed at a future point in time
- Scheduled task completed - A scheduled task that was running finished execution
- HTTP request - The app made an outbound HTTP request to an external API
- HTTP response - An outbound HTTP request the app made completed with the given response
- Request for API workflow - An API endpoint in our workflow API was called
- Sending email failed - Bubble was unable to send an email because of an error

Server log entries

For each log entry, you will see a number of fields:

- Name: the name of the item relevant to the log, which sometimes is what kind of log it is or the name of a specific workflow action, for example
- Email: the email of the user associated with this log running, often the end-user causing the workflow / action to happen
- ID: the unique ID of the user with the email above
- Timestamp: when the log happened, in your local time
- Message / properties: the body of the log, which gives information about that particular entry; the information available will depend on what kind of log it is

Scheduler

One feature of Bubble is the ability to set a workflow to run later at a certain time or on a recurring basis going into the future. You can see any such scheduled future workflows on this sub-tab.

Scheduler entries

Each result from the search represents a scheduled workflow that will run in the future. For each result, you see the following information:

- Scheduled time: when the workflow will run, represented in your local time
- ID: the ID of this scheduled workflow, which you can use, for example, to cancel that scheduled workflow from another workflow
- API event: the workflow that will run
- Current user: generally signifies which user caused this workflow to be scheduled (may not map to the user whose permissions will be applied when the workflow runs, as that can be configured in the definition of the workflow itself)
- Parameters: any parameters that workflow will run with, as expected in the definition of the workflow

Inline page search

[](https://youtu.be/7N5MNPdAOmA)

Our Academy quick tip on how to search for pages and elements in the Design tab

Search your application for pages or reusable elements by name in the leftmost dropdown, or search the elements on the current page in the next dropdown.

Undo

Undo the last change. You can undo all changes made since the last page load.

Redo

Redo an undo change.

Recent releases

The Gift icon indicates that new features and fixes have been added to Bubble. Clicking here opens a popup that lists the changes since the last time you visited the application editor.

Viewing mode

UI Builder and Responsive are the two different viewing modes. The app is designed and edited in the UI Builder mode. Responsive mode shows how the app will behave in different situations and screen widths.

Selection mode

If you select an element in the Palette and then decide not to add that element, click this button to deselect the item and return to edit mode.

Show / Hide element edges

Shows the element edges to help with design.

Show element labels

Elements on the canvas will display an icon on them as an indicator if the element needs data or a workflow to function (i.e. a button or repeating group). If the element has data, a workflow, or a note attached to it, the indicator will be solid. If the note on an element has not been read, the indicator will be yellow. To help distinguish between individual elements and reusables, individuals will be blue and reusables will be purple.

X-Ray mode

Sometimes the page will have many elements, and you need to see if something is behind another element. Toggling the X-Ray mode shows all elements with some amount of transparency. Users will never see this view, but it is convenient for development and design purposes.

Disable element thumbnails on hover

When hovering an expression or workflow that uses an element, you will see a helpful thumbnail preview of this element. This can decrease performance on slower computers, so you can disable that in the canvas settings.

Lock Property Editor

When this option is on, the Property Editor pane will be locked on the right side of the Design canvas instead of being draggable.

Show distances

When this option is on, the editor will show the distances in pixels between the selected element the the currently hovered element.

Grid options

This dropdown menu offers different grid options, such as showing/hiding the grid, defining a color, and snapping to the grid or edges.

Zoom

You can zoom in or out on the page for more precision. Note that this feature isn't available on Firefox currently.

Arrange options

This dropdown menu offers different options to organize elements on the page. Choose from Bring to Front, Send to back, Center horizontally/vertically, Align left/top/bottom/right, Distribute horizontally/vertically, and Group/Ungroup elements.

Preview

Click this button to see your application in run mode. By default, the debugger will be turned on when you're running your application from this button. If you hover the button for a second, you will see more preview options; you will be able to run the application without the custom HTML that you added to the page, and without adding community plugins (built by the community). These modes are useful when you are debugging your app, as some custom code can sometime conflict with Bubble's native behavior.

**Understanding page load times:** When you update your app, Bubble optimizes it in the background for faster future loads. After significant changes, the initial load might be slower while these optimizations occur. This delay, typically brief, won't recur until the next major update.

This optimization happens separately for Development and Live, so infrequent deployments to live may make this more noticeable.

Search Tool

The Search Tool searches the app for elements, styles, and other objects. Advanced searches can be performed, such as finding all elements and actions that use or modify a field. When you click the search results, the Bubble Editor will take you to the requested items. All the found elements can be edited at once by clicking on 'Edit these elements.' Caution: This can modify elements across many pages.

User manual article: [Using the search tool](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/navigating-the-bubble-editor/tools/the-search-tool)​

Issue Checker

While building your app, you might overlook certain fields or encounter data mismatches. The Issue Checker aids in identifying and addressing these problems. By selecting it, you'll see a list of outstanding issues.

Clicking on a specific issue navigates you directly to the problematic element or action for correction.

When using the Issue checker, keep in mind the following:

- We recommend resolving issues as soon as they arise, as you will not be able to deploy your app before they are resolved
   - Having a very large number of issues in the tracker can also lead to degraded performance in the Bubble editor
- Bubble performs extensive behind-the-scenes computations to identify issues. For particularly large apps, you might notice additional issues on a specific page only after accessing it. We recommend opening the different pages in your app to make sure the issue tracker has caught everything before deploying app-wide changes

**Known issue:** In certain cases, like with Plugin element inputs, the Issue Checker will mark text fields filled out with an empty string (ie. "") as empty. Either enter text, or " ", if this is a required field that you'd like to keep blank.

Component Library

The Component Library is a collection of pre-built User Interface (UI) components that can be dragged and dropped onto your page to help you build beautiful interfaces faster. These UI components are fully responsive and are made up of containers, visual elements, and form inputs that can be individually customized once added to your page.

Each component is a fully independent unit, but can be connected to each other or other parts of your app by adding workflows and data. You can learn more about using the component library to build a page in the [Help Guide.](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/the-component-library)​

The Component Library contains a handful of the most common UI components used in web applications today. Each type of UI component has 3 to 4 different versions that can be selected based on personal preference. New UI components will be regularly added to the Component Library.

User manual article: [The Component Library](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/the-component-library) User manual article series: [Design](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design)​

Header

Header components are commonly found at the top of most landing pages and contain placeholder links that allow your users to navigate to the most important parts of your application. The header component also contains a placeholder for your company's logo and buttons for users to login and signup.

The Login and Signup buttons are not connected to any workflows by default. Refer to the [Help Guide](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/the-component-library) to learn more about connecting these buttons to the Signup/Login component.

Hero

A Hero component is typically the first section of your landing page under the header. This section is used to grab the users attention and communicate your brand and what your application has to offer. The hero component contains placeholders for a large image, header text, smaller subtitle text, and CTA's (or "calls to action" buttons) for your users.

Value Props

A Value Props section is used to communicate the key differentiators, or value, that your application can deliver to your users. This section is typically found beneath the Hero Section as it allows you to go into more detail about your web app. The value props component contains placeholders for multiple sets of images, text, and CTA's to help you describe your application's value proposition.

Footer

Footer components are found at the very bottom of a landing page. The footer component is generally used to provide a more detailed map of links to different pages of your website, how to find your company on social media, and any copyright information. The Footer component contains placeholder links, a placeholder for your logo, and buttons for linking to your social media accounts.

Signup/Login

The Signup/Login component is used to allow your users to sign up for an account or login to your website. The Signup/Login component contains two forms that can be toggled depending on which form you'd like to show your users. Both groups overlap each other, so this is done by conditionally hiding one group and showing the other. Learn more about how to use the Signup/Login form in your app in the [Help Guide.](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-M5sbzuRIc8h2FO4jxw-/s/-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL/~/changes/2HZMw3DLyewvgmpKtyZa/help-guides/building-a-user-interface/using-the-component-library)​

The Login and Signup buttons are not connected to any workflows by default. Refer to the [Help Guide](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/the-component-library) to learn more about connecting these buttons to the workflows that will signup or login your users.

 Top and context menu options

This reference entry lists all the different options available in the top menus and context menu. The available options in these can vary depending on where you are in the editor and what object you have selected.

To find the option you are looking for we recommend using the Docs search tool or using Bubble's in-editor documentation links.

Undo

Undo the last change. You can undo all changes made since the last page load.

Redo

Redo an undo change.

Edit

Edits the current selection, e.g., element, action, event.

Edit reusable

Navigates the design editor to edit the currently selected reusable element.

Edit page

Edits the current page.

Delete

Deletes the current selection, e.g., element, action, event, style.

Replace by another type

This action replaces an element/action/event by another element/action/event of a different type. For example, change an element from a checkbox to a toggle or from a group to a popup.

Note: This operation may lead to inconsistencies if the data type changes and a different input is needed. Review the Issue checker to ensure no issues were introduced. Undo this change, if necessary.

Convert to a reusable element

This option takes a group of elements and converts them into a reusable element.

Detach reusable element

This option takes a reusable element and converts them to a group that contains the same elements and workflows as the original reusable element.

Limitations for repeating groups

The *Detach reusable element* function comes with a few limitations:

- Once a reusable element that contains a workflow event is detached from a repeating group cell, the workflow belongs to the page and cannot reference a specific cell's data. This limitation applies specifically to workflow events that are not attached to an element, such as "Do every 5 seconds" as opposed to "When button is clicked," in a reusable element within a repeating group cell.
- Once a reusable element containing a popup, group focus, or floating group is detached within a repeating group cell, any data that is inherited from the repeating group cell will not be automatically passed to the detached container since they are now a part of the page. A workflow will need to be set up specifically to send the data to the detached group.
- If a reusable element within a repeating group cell contains a group focus, and the group focus references an element within the reusable element, detaching the reusable element will result in the group focus being unable to reference the element within the repeating group cell, since the container is now a part of the page.
- If a reusable element inside a repeating group cell that includes an element linked to an action to display a group focus is detached, the action will lose its reference to the group focus and no longer be able to display it.

Group elements in a Group

[](https://youtu.be/HWmgmzIQRfg)

Our Academy quick tip on how to group elements together

This option takes the selected elements and creates a new group. You can choose with container layout type you'd like to group the elements in. The options are as follows:

- ​[Group elements in a Fixed container](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/responsive-propertiegroup-elements-fixed)​
- ​[Group elements in a Row container](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/responsive-propertiegroup-elements-row)​
- ​[Group elements in a Column container](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/responsive-propertiegroup-elements-column)​
- ​[Group elements in an Align-to-Parent container](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/responsive-propertiegroup-elements-align-to-parent)​

Ungroup these elements

[](https://youtu.be/HWmgmzIQRfg)

Add a new reusable element...

Creates a new reusable element. Choose an existing element or clone a reusable element.

Clone this reusable element

Creates a new reusable element with the current element's properties.

Backend workflows

This page is for editing the different backend workflows used in the app - the common characteristic of all backend workflows is that they run on the server, i.e. they are not tied to a specific page of the app. There are three types of backend workflows you can define:

- API workflows: a general workflow that can be initiated from elsewhere in the app or via the Workflow API (see [Workflow API](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/workflow-apapi-event-endpoint))
- Recurring workflows: a workflow that is set to run at a certain frequency (see [Recurring Event](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/events/recurring-event))
- Database change trigger: a workflow that runs when any change of any thing of a specified data type happens (see [Trigger Event](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/events/trigger-event))

 Deployment and version control

This is the short-form technical reference entry describing version control. If you are looking for more in-depth and long-form content on how it works, you may be interested in reading the [version control manual](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/maintaining-an-application/version-control).

If you are transitioning to the new version control in an app that currently has at least one custom branch, we recommend reading our [version control transition guide](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/maintaining-an-application/version-control/transitioning).

Version control provides distinct Development and Live environments that exist in parallel, enabling continuous application development without affecting the live application. This system also facilitates the creation of customized branches to segregate projects and divide them into more manageable components.

Selecting environments

To select an environment, click on the Live option or choose one of the available branches listed under the Development section in the branch tree.

Live environment

Live branch

The live branch is your live site on the web. It cannot be edited directly.

Create a hotfix

This will create a hotfix branch to make urgent updates to your application. The hotfix branch is connected to the Development database. While a hotfix branch exists, deployment from Main will be blocked. You'll be prompted for a confirmation before the branch is created..

Hotfix branch

Create savepoint

Create Savepoint lets you capture a snapshot of the current state of the hotfix branch. You can include a description to identify the save point later.

Deploy to Live

This will deploy the changes you have in hotfix to Live. You'll be prompted for a confirmation before the process starts where you can provide a description for the deployment. Once it has been deployed, the hotfix branch will be deleted and a savepoint will be created automatically with the description you provided.

Reset to Live

Click to reset the hotfix branch to match Live. You will retain savepoints and can restore to a savepoint or custom date/time at any time after resetting to undo it. You will be prompted for a confirmation before the process starts.

Delete

This will delete the hotfix branch. You will be prompted for a written confirmation before the branch is deleted.

Development environment

The Main branch

The Main branch is where your app is developed and tested before being deployed.

Load a branch

To load a branch, click it in the branch tree.

Create a new branch

Any branch that you created under the Main branch is known as a custom branch. Select the branch that you want to be the parent of the new branch and click the Create a new branch button. You will be prompted for a name and description. The new branch will be created as a child branch to the currently selected branch.

Next to the create button you will see a count of the remaining custom branch spots you have available in your current plan.

If you have created the maximum number of branches available in your plan, the Create new branch button will instead say Upgrade to add more branches.

Edit description

This option in the more options dropdown lets you edit the description of the currently selected branch.

Deploy to Live

This will deploy the changes you have in the Main branch to Live. You'll be prompted for a confirmation before the process starts where you can provide a description for the deployment. A savepoint will be created automatically with the description you provided.

 Deployment & Version Control Dropdown (legacy)

All Bubble apps have at least two versions, a live version and a development version (called "test" by default), whose changes can be deployed to live. This dropdown allows you to switch between versions, deploy a development version to live, create save points, revert a version to previous points in time, create or delete versions, and, in the case of multi-version apps, sync recent changes from live into a development version. It is important to note that deploying and reverting an app version does not affect the database, e.g., the things users created. However, it will copy or revert the data types because they are part of the app.

Create save point

[](https://youtu.be/ItGIoY8Lsuk)

Our Academy quick tip on how to use save points

Click this button to attach a label to the current state of the active version. This marks a point in the app history, which makes it easier to get back to this point if needed. Any version, live or development, can be reverted to via the history popup.

Deploy Development to Live

[](https://youtu.be/1FkN8jxRyNg)

Our Academy course includes how to deploy your Bubble app

Click this button to push the current development version to Live. Enter a description of the changes to be deployed for reference.

FYI

As you change your app, Bubble does calculations behind-the-scenes to help optimize page load times in the future. One consequence of this is that the first time an app is visited in runmode after a lot of new changes have been made, that first load may be a bit slower as Bubble does its calculations. This slowness on the first load should not happen again after the calculation is done (which usually takes at most a couple of minutes), until of course the next time major changes are made. Note that this calculation happens separately for your development vs. live versions, so if you aren't deploying to live frequently, this effect may be more noticeable there.

Create a new version

Users on Team or Professional plans can create multiple development versions of an app, which can be switched between and deleted from the version dropdown. Click this button to create a new version. Once this version is created, it can no longer be renamed (this feature was deprecated in December 2021).

Sync with live

When one development version of a multi-version app is deployed to live, the others become out of sync with live, meaning they do not yet incorporate recent changes and cannot be deployed. Syncing resolves this state, adding recent changes to live to the active development version. In cases where two changes conflict directly, the user will be prompted to select the change to keep.

Click this icon to add changes to another version

Click to add changes from the highlighted version to your current version since the versions were last in sync. In the event that one of these edits from the highlighted version conflicts directly with a change you made to your current version, you'll be prompted to chose which you'd like to keep.

**Example:** Let's say you just made a bunch of exciting updates to your app in version `my-updates`and you'd like to add them to your `Development` version. First, make sure your current version is set to `Development`. Then, click the "Add changes from" icon next to version `my-updates` to merge in these updates to your version `Development`.

History popup

The history popup allows you to revert the active version to any point in its history, as limited by your plan. Changes in Bubble are granular, meaning you can revert to any point in time. Save points serve as handy attached to specific times, making it easy to revert to the correct spot.

Date inputs

Revert the app to a previous version based on a particular date. Limitations may apply based on your Bubble plan. Enter the date and time to define the version to use for the restoration. Using your time zone, type the date '01/17/2016' and hour '22:56:41' into the two input fields. Or, use the copy time button in the list of previous deployments on the right if you want to use an existing timestamp in the app's deployment history.

Revert to this time

Click this button after entering the date and time. You will be prompted to confirm the operation.

Previous deployments and reverts

This is a list of the deployments and restorations for this app. For each deployment, the description along with a date and timestamp is displayed.

 Elements

Elements are things you draw on pages. They display images, text, and other information and enable users to interact with the app. Elements have properties that are controlled in the property editor in the Bubble editor.

Elements are classified into three categories:

- **Visual elements:** Used to display information and trigger workflows when users interact with them (such as clicking a button)
- **Containers:** Elements that contain other elements.
- **Input forms:** Elements that users use to enter information.

Elements are either part of Bubble's core library or added with plugins.

Sections

This section covers all of the elements in the core library, respective parameters, and shared properties.

General properties

An element's general properties determines what they look like and how they behave.

​[List of general properties](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/shared-properties)

If you are unfamiliar with what elements are, you can explore the more in-depth article series below:

User manual article series: [Elements](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements)​

Conditional formatting

Conditional formatting means to change the visibility or appearance of an element based on specific conditions.

States

States (not to be confused with custom states) are situations the element can find itself in, such as being hovered or visible.

​[States](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/states)​

Page element

The page element is the fundamental element that contains all the other elements. Each page gets assigned a custom URL in your app.

Input forms

Input forms are elements that accept some sort of input from the user, such as text, numbers, dates and file uploads.

​[Input form properties](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/input-forms)​

There are many different types of input forms, and to learn more about the different types we recommend checking out the more in-depth user manual articles below. You can also extend the number of different input forms with plugins.

Reusable elements

Reusable elements are collections of elements that can be re-used across your app. For example, if your app has a footer section, you can set that up as a reusable element and use across every page that needs that footer.

 General Properties

The properties here apply to all elements in Bubble.

Changing the parent element's type

This option modifies the type of content of the parent element on the fly. The type of content defines what type of thing a group should expect, so that you can refer to it when editing the app. For example, a group can receive a user, who isn't necessarily the current user, and then you can add a text element in the group to display the 'Parent group's user's email.'

This element is visible on page load

Check this box to make the element visible by default. This checkbox makes the element visible every time the page loads or reloads. Change the visibility of the element based on certain conditions in the Conditional section in the Property Editor or with a show/hide element action in a workflow. To find hidden elements quickly, click the 'Only show hideable' checkbox in the Elements tree in the Palette. Clicking on the name shows or hides the element for editing purposes only. Like other properties, this setting can be overwritten by a condition on an element or by a show/hide action in a workflow. Actions take precedence over conditions which take precedence over the default setting.

**Note on security:** Be aware that tech-savvy users can access the underlying static content of any page, even if certain elements are hidden from their view. As such, never place sensitive information such as private URLs or tokens in hidden elements on the page.

You can read more about maintaining page security in our dedicated article below:

User manual article: [Page security](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/infrastructure/security/page-security)​

Replace element

Click this button to replace an element with an element of a different type. For example, change an element from a checkbox to a toggle or from a group to a popup.

This operation may lead to inconsistencies, so check the Issues Checker to make sure no new issues are introduced. If you are experiencing issue, you can use Undo to revert the change.

Style

Select a style from this dropdown menu to apply to the selected element. Styles are defined in the Styles Tab and can be applied to more than one element. When a style is modified, all elements with that style will automatically change. Using styles makes editing the app faster and ensures a consistent design.

Detach style

Clicking this button detaches the style from the selected element. The style association is detached, but the properties of the style remain on the element. The style is not changed or deleted, only detached from the specific element.

Edit style

Clicking this button displays the Styles Tab and selects the current element's style.

Override style

To override a style, change one of its values. The style dropdown will show an *(overriden).*

Reset

To reset the elements style back to the selected style, click *Reset* next to *Appearance settings*. This button is only visible when the style is overriden.

Notes on resetting styles

A few notes on the behavior of Style overrides:

- Resetting will change any overridden values on a tab by tab basis
- If you override any values, and then update the attached Style, the overridden values will not change - even if those settings on the Style were updated
- If you override any values, and then detach the Style, the overridden values will not change
- If you override any values, and then detach the Style, and then reattach a Style, the overridden values will be removed in favor of the new Style’s inherited values.
- If you override any values, and then change the overridden value back to the original value, the value will still be considered an override. To “re-attach” the value, use the reset button
- If you override any values, and then create a new Style from the element, the overridden values will carry over to the new Style
- Conditionals cannot be overridden yet. If you want to override an inherited conditional, simply add a new style that has the behavior you want since conditionals are evaluated from top to bottom

Select parent

Choose an element from this dropdown menu to contain the selected element. This is convenient when an element is contained by a group with the same dimensions.

Reveal in Elements Tree

Clicking this button shows where the element is in the Elements tree in the Palette.

Lock this element (not draggable in editor)

When this box is checked, the element will not be draggable in the Bubble Editor. This is useful when working on large pages. This has no impact in run mode.

ID Attribute (advanced)

If you activate the option Expose the option to add an ID attribute to HTML elements in the Settings Tab, you can specific a unique ID for some element on the page. This ID will be applied in run mode to the outer div around the element. This is an advanced feature. Warning: Bubble does not guarantee that the internal structure of the divs will remain the same over time. What is guaranteed here is the ID will be applied to the outer element. Keep this mind as you use IDs.

Margins

Margins create extra space around an element. Margins define the overall size of a visual element on the page and how it interacts with elements around it in both fixed and responsive layouts.

For example, in a fixed container layout, margins can be used to provide even spacing around elements in a form. In a row container layout, margins will be added to the min and max width of the element to inform when the element should wrap to the next row.

In addition, margins will align and snap based on the margin border, not the element border. If the margin is 0, the margin border and element border will be the same.

Margin controls are available on all elements in the Layout tab of the property editor. These controls are also available in conditional statements to replace the legacy responsive “collapse margins” functionality.

**Tip:** In a responsive container, margins will help you position a child element where you want it once you have selected the appropriate alignment option. For example, if you have a button in a **column** container and you want the button to be 30px from the bottom of the container, simply **bottom-align** the button and add 30px of margin to the bottom of the button element.

![image.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F14abNVK9GTpoTw0pBllm%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=d6ceccb2-edf0-403d-86ac-ff96d60297a5)

Top

Specify the amount of margin at the top of the element in pixels.

Right

Specify the amount of margin on the right side of the element in pixels.

Bottom

Specify the amount of margin to the bottom of the element in pixels.

Left

Specify the amount of margin on the left side of the element in pixels.

Padding

Padding creates extra space within an element. In general, padding defines the amount of "usable" space inside of an element. Since new padding controls are only available on Containers (for now), padding will define how close to the edge of a parent container a child element is allowed to get.

For example, in a Column container layout, a padding of 30px on the left and ride side of the container will add 30px of space inside the container on each side. If the Parent container's width is set to 420 px, the largest width any child element could have is 360px - (420px - (30px *2)).

If a parent container has padding applied, child elements will align or snap on the boundaries of the padding area, not the container border.

Similar to margins, padding controls are also available in conditional statements.

**Note:** New padding controls are only available on container elements for the time being. All visual elements will be getting new padding controls soon as well.

**Note**: Padding values can now be set in Styles in the Layout tab. Padding values can be manually edited on a per element basis without changing the Style defaults.

![image (1).png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F0Ka5brvZVX1Ja8DmnHqt%2Fimage%20(1).png?alt=media&token=3a8d0189-2b33-48bc-883f-62ffef3a77f0)

Top

Specify the amount of padding at the top of the container in pixels.

Right

Specify the amount of padding on the right side of the container in pixels.

Bottom

Specify the amount of padding to the bottom of the container in pixels.

Left

Specify the amount of padding on the left side of the container in pixels.

Style / Style (overridden)

![style-padding.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FeHdIHK9oytAlgDjR6Cjo%2Fstyle-padding.png?alt=media&token=ad7f8a3d-12a6-42c3-9d9f-a55410289734)

If padding is applied to this element from a Style, click this link to navigate to the Styles tab to make edits to the Style as needed. If you have made changes to the padding that differ from the style, the link will say *Style (overridden)*. You can reset to the style's setting using the [*Reset* link](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/shared-propertiereset) on the right-hand side.

If you don't have a style applied, this setting will not be visible.

Actions take precedence over conditions which take precedence over the default setting.

Note that savvy end-users can 'see' (through technical means) the static content of any page they visit, even if the elements are hidden to that end-user and never revealed. This means you should not include any sensitive static content in hidden elements on the page - content like sensitive URLs or private tokens.

Replace element

Click this button to replace an element with an element of a different type. For example, change an element from a checkbox to a toggle or from a group to a popup. Note: This operation may lead to inconsistencies, so check the Issues Checker to make sure no new issues are introduced. Undo this change, if necessary.

 Styling Properties

These are common styling properties that can be applied to most elements in the Bubble Editor. They include borders, backgrounds, shadows, fonts, etc. These are also properties included in Styles.

General

Opacity

Defines the opacity of the entire element. 100 is fully opaque while 0 is fully transparent.

**Note:** This is different than the opacity input, or alpha value, on the color picker. That value sets the opacity of the color itself. This setting sets the opacity of the entire element.

Dimensions

These properties control the size and positioning of the selected element.

Width

Defines the width of the selected element in pixels.

Height

Defines the height of the selected element in pixels. This height adjusts if the element or content inside a container is 'Set to stretch to fit content.' In this case, the number entered here is the minimum height for that element.

Left

Defines the horizontal position in pixels relative to the left border of the containing element, which is either a group or popup or the page.

Top

Defines the vertical position in pixels relative to the top border of the containing element, which is either a group, a popup, or the page.

Rotation angle

Rotate the selected element by entering a number in this field. This number is expressed in degrees.

Shadows

These properties define a shadow for the selected element.

Shadow style

Choose from None, Outset, and Inset to define a shadow to the selected element. Inset sets a show inside the element. Outset sets a show outside the element.

Horizontal offset

Defines the position of the horizontal shadow. Negative values are allowed.

Vertical offset

Defines the position of the vertical shadow. Negative values are allowed.

Shadow Blur radius

Define the blur distance in pixels. A higher number means a more diffuse shadow, and a lower number means a sharper shadow.

Shadow spread radius

Positive values will cause the shadow to expand and grow bigger, negative values will cause the shadow to shrink. If not specified, it will be 0 (the shadow will be the same size as the element).

Shadow color

Defines the color of the shadow. Tip: Experiment with the transparency of the color.

Font options

These properties style text.

Font

Select the font family to apply to the selected element. Choose from the hundreds of fonts in the Google Fonts Library.

Font Weight

Select the font weight to apply to the selected element. Choose from standard weights ranging from 100 to 900.

**Note:** Not all fonts have all 9 weights.

Font Size

Enter a font size in pixels for the text.

Bold

Makes the text darker and thicker.

Italic

Makes the text slanted.

Underline

Underlines the text. This is useful in conditional formatting, when a link is hovered, for instance.

Text Alignment

Aligns the text. Choose from Left, Center, and Right.

Font Color

Select the text color.

Placeholder color

Select the color to apply to the placeholder of the input element.

Font Shadow

These properties add a shadow to texts.

Show text shadow

Check this box to show a shadow on the text.

Horizontal offset

Defines the position of the horizontal shadow. Negative values are allowed.

Vertical offset

Defines the position of the vertical shadow. Negative values are allowed.

Font Shadow Blur Radius

Define the blur distance in pixels. A higher number means a more diffuse shadow, and a lower number means a sharper shadow.

Font shadow Color

Select the color of the shadow. Tip: Experiment with the transparency of the color.

Font options

These options control text spacing.

Word spacing

Define the space between words in pixels.

Line spacing

Define the line height in pixels.

Letter spacing

Define the space between letters in pixels.

Borders

These properties define the borders of the elements.

**Note:** Top and left borders on an element will nudge the center alignment of items inside that element (e.g. text). One workaround is to have a text element inside of another element (e.g. group), and apply the border to the outside element instead.

Define each border independently

Check this box if borders are to be set independently.

Border style

Choose a style for the border. Choose from None, Dotted, Dashed, Double, Groove, Ridge, Inset, and Offset.

Border roundness

Define the border radius in pixels.

Border Width

Define the border width in pixels.

Border color

Select the border color.

Tooltip on hover

Tooltip text (on hover)

This text is displayed by the browser when the user hovers over it with the mouse. Technically, it sets a title attribute to the element it is applied to.

Padding

These properties let you select the space between the borders and the actual content of the element.

Top

Specify the amount of padding at the top of the container in pixels.

Right

Specify the amount of padding on the right side of the container in pixels.

Bottom

Specify the amount of padding to the bottom of the container in pixels.

Left

Specify the amount of padding on the left side of the container in pixels.

Center the text vertically

Check this box to center the text vertically.

**Tip:** Top and left borders on an element will nudge the center alignment of items inside that element (e.g. text). One workaround is to have a text element inside of another element (e.g. group), and apply the border to the outside element instead.

Background

These options define the background of the elements: color, image, etc.

Background style

Select the background style to apply to the element. Choose from None, Flat color, Gradient, and Image.

Background Color

Select the background color for the element.

Gradient style

Choose from Linear and Radial to define the gradient style.

Gradient direction

Choose from Top, Left, Bottom, Right, and Custom to define the gradient direction.

Direction degrees

Enter a value between 0 and 360 for the direction of the gradient.

Gradient shape

Defines the shape of the gradient. Choose from Ellipse and Circle.

Gradient base

Select a screen location from this dropdown menu to determine where to base the gradient. Choose from Closest-side, Closest-corner, Farthest-side, and Farthest-corner.

X center position (%)

Define the horizontal centering position. 50% will center the gradient.

Y center position (%)

Define the vertical centering position. 50% will center the gradient.

Starting color

Select the starting color of the gradient.

Ending color

Select the ending color of the gradient.

Intermediate color

Select the optional middle color of the gradient. If the input is empty, no intermediate color will be applied.

Background image

Upload or define a dynamic image. Select an image from the Bubble royalty-free library, if desired.

Center the image

Centers the image in the element.

Make image as wide as parent element

If the element is wider than the element selected, the image will automatically resize to cover the entire element.

Crop the image to fit the element size

In Responsive mode, checking this option makes sure the element's background image will be cropped to fill the entire element's background without distorting the image.

Repeat the image vertically

Repeat the image vertically if the image is smaller than the element's height.

Repeat the image horizontally

Repeat the image horizontally if the image is narrower than the element's width.

Background color if empty

When using a dynamic image, it might take a few milliseconds for the image to load. In the meantime, select a background color for the element. The default is transparent.

Bubble renders the page to adjust to the screen width, i.e, responsive layout. A few options control the behavior of the page.

These properties control the size and positioning of the selected element.

Width

Defines the width of the selected element in pixels.

Height

Defines the height of the selected element in pixels. This height adjusts if the element or content inside a container is 'Set to stretch to fit content.' In this case, the number entered here is the minimum height for that element.

Left

Defines the horizontal position in pixels relative to the left border of the containing element, which is either a group or popup or the page.

Top

Defines the vertical position in pixels relative to the top border of the containing element, which is either a group, a popup, or the page.

Rotation angle

Rotate the selected element by entering a number in this field. This number is expressed in degrees.

Shadows

These properties define a shadow for the selected element.

Shadow style

Choose from None, Outset, and Inset to define a shadow to the selected element. Inset sets a show inside the element. Outset sets a show outside the element.

Horizontal offset

Defines the position of the horizontal shadow. Negative values are allowed.

Vertical offset

Defines the position of the vertical shadow. Negative values are allowed.

Shadow Blur radius

Define the blur distance in pixels. A higher number means a more diffuse shadow, and a lower number means a sharper shadow.

Shadow spread radius

Positive values will cause the shadow to expand and grow bigger, negative values will cause the shadow to shrink. If not specified, it will be 0 (the shadow will be the same size as the element).

Shadow color

Defines the color of the shadow. Tip: Experiment with the transparency of the color.

Font options

These properties style text.

Font

Select the font family to apply to the selected element. Choose from the hundreds of fonts in the Google Fonts Library.

Font Size

Enter a font size in pixels for the text.

Bold

Makes the text darker and thicker.

Italic

Makes the text slanted.

Underline

Underlines the text. This is useful in conditional formatting, when a link is hovered, for instance.

Text Alignment

Aligns the text. Choose from Left, Center, and Right.

Font Color

Select the text color.

Placeholder color

Select the color to apply to the placeholder of the input element.

Font Shadow

These properties add a shadow to texts.

Show text shadow

Check this box to show a shadow on the text.

Horizontal offset

Defines the position of the horizontal shadow. Negative values are allowed.

Vertical offset

Defines the position of the vertical shadow. Negative values are allowed.

Font Shadow Blur Radius

Define the blur distance in pixels. A higher number means a more diffuse shadow, and a lower number means a sharper shadow.

Font shadow Color

Select the color of the shadow. Tip: Experiment with the transparency of the color.

Font options

These options control text spacing.

Word spacing

Define the space between words in pixels.

Line spacing

Define the line height in pixels.

Letter spacing

Define the space between letters in pixels.

Borders

These properties define the borders of the elements.

**Note:** Top and left borders on an element will nudge the center alignment of items inside that element (e.g. text). One workaround is to have a text element inside of another element (e.g. group), and apply the border to the outside element instead.

Define each border independently

Check this box if borders are to be set independently.

Border style

Choose a style for the border. Choose from None, Dotted, Dashed, Double, Groove, Ridge, Inset, and Offset.

Border roundness

Define the border radius in pixels.

Border Width

Define the border width in pixels.

Border color

Select the border color.

Tooltip on hover

Tooltip text (on hover)

This text is displayed by the browser when the user hovers over it with the mouse. Technically, it sets a title attribute to the element it is applied to.

Padding

These properties let you select the space between the borders and the actual content of the element.

Vertical padding

Vertical distance in pixels between the top border and the element content.

Horizontal padding

Horizontal distance in pixels between the left border and the element content.

Center the text vertically

Check this box to center the text vertically.

**Note:** If text is centered vertically but is long enough to be multiple rows, only the first row will be in the vertical center of the element. If you are using the [New Responsive Engine [beta]](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/styling-properties-1), the feature will work as expected.

**Tip:** Top and left borders on an element will nudge the center alignment of items inside that element (e.g. text). One workaround is to have a text element inside of another element (e.g. group), and apply the border to the outside element instead.

Background

These options define the background of the elements: color, image, etc.

Background style

Select the background style to apply to the element. Choose from None, Flat color, Gradient, and Image.

Background Color

Select the background color for the element.

Gradient style

Choose from Linear and Radial to define the gradient style.

Gradient direction

Choose from Top, Left, Bottom, Right, and Custom to define the gradient direction.

Direction degrees

Enter a value between 0 and 360 for the direction of the gradient.

Gradient shape

Defines the shape of the gradient. Choose from Ellipse and Circle.

Gradient base

Select a screen location from this dropdown menu to determine where to base the gradient. Choose from Closest-side, Closest-corner, Farthest-side, and Farthest-corner.

X center position (%)

Define the horizontal centering position. 50% will center the gradient.

Y center position (%)

Define the vertical centering position. 50% will center the gradient.

Starting color

Select the starting color of the gradient.

Ending color

Select the ending color of the gradient.

Intermediate color

Select the optional middle color of the gradient. If the input is empty, no intermediate color will be applied.

Background image

Upload or define a dynamic image. Select an image from the Bubble royalty-free library, if desired.

Center the image

Centers the image in the element.

Make image as wide as parent element

If the element is wider than the element selected, the image will automatically resize to cover the entire element.

Crop the image to fit the element size

In Responsive mode, checking this option makes sure the element's background image will be cropped to fill the entire element's background without distorting the image.

Repeat the image vertically

Repeat the image vertically if the image is smaller than the element's height.

Repeat the image horizontally

Repeat the image horizontally if the image is narrower than the element's width.

Background color if empty

When using a dynamic image, it might take a few milliseconds for the image to load. In the meantime, select a background color for the element. The default is transparent.

Bubble renders the page to adjust to the screen width, i.e, responsive layout. A few options control the behavior of the page.

​

----
 Responsive Properties

The following responsive properties are generally available for all elements. Containers also have responsive layout types that determine what additional layout properties its child elements have. These are outlined in the [Containers](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/containers) section.

Preset page width (page only)

- Custom: Default setting.
- Full width: Sets page width to 1200.
- Centered: Sets page width to 980.
- Mobile: Sets page width to 380.

Width for UI Builder (page only)

Set the width of the page while in UI Builder mode. This option is only available for responsive container layout types (i.e. not Fixed) since these containers at the page level will grow to fit whatever the screen size is in run-mode. In the Responsive tab, you will be able to drag the canvas to see how the layout reacts to different screen sizes.

Parent container type

The container layout type of the parent container. Clicking edit brings you to the property editor of the parent container.

Keep element aspect ratio fixed

Check this box to maintain the current aspect ratio of the element as the parent container is resized. Only available for shapes, icons, and images.

Make this element fixed-width

Check this box if you want the element to maintain a fixed width as the parent container resizes. If not, you will need to specify a minimum and maximum width.

Width

Enter the width of the element in pixels.

Min width

Specify the smallest width the element should be allowed to get as the parent container resizes. This value can be set in pixels or percentage relative to the parent container.

Max width

Specify the largest width the element should be allowed to get as the parent container resizes. This value can be set in pixels or percentage relative to the parent container. If left blank, the maximum width will default to infinite, which means it will stay as wide as the parent container.

**Note:** Child elements will always try to grow to their max width, unless restricted by other elements or its parent container.

Fit width to content

Check this box to shrink this container to the width of the widest child element or its min width. Otherwise, the container will grow to its max width or the width of its parent container, whatever is smaller.

Make this element fixed-height

Check this box if you want the element to maintain a fixed height even if its content or parent container grows. If not, you will need to specify a minimum and maximum height.

Height

Enter the height of the element in pixels.

Min height

Specify the smallest height you want the element to get in pixels or percentage relative to the parent container.

Max height

Specify the largest height you want the element to get in pixels or percentage relative to the parent container. If left blank, the maximum height will default to infinite, which means it will stay as tall as the parent container.

**Note:** Child elements will always try to grow to their max height, unless restricted by other elements or its parent container.

Fit height to content

Check this box to shrink this container to the height of the tallest child element. Otherwise, the container will grow to its max height or height of its parent container, whatever is smaller.

**Note:** This setting is only available on container elements inside a parent container with a layout type of align to parent or column.

X

Enter the x-axis position of the element’s top left corner relative to the parent container in pixels.

Y

Enter the y-axis position of the element’s top left corner relative to the parent container in pixels.

Collapse when hidden

Check this box to collapse or remove the element from its parent container when the element is not visible. This will free up space for other elements to move (if applicable). If unchecked, the element will still be invisible, it will just continue taking up space in the parent element. This checkbox is the way to replicate hidden functionality from the legacy responsive engine.

Allow vertical scrolling when content overflows

Check this box to add a scrollbar to the group container when the content is longer than the max height of the group container.

Scrollbars, especially when in repeating groups, can sometimes cause elements to appear slightly different than designed on certain browsers and devices. This is because Bubble relies on the end-user's operating system and browser to determine how a scrollbar should look.

Group elements in a Fixed container

Select this option from the Arrange or right click menu when multiple elements are selected to group the elements in a Fixed container. Learn more about fixed containers [here](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/responsive-properties).

Group elements in a Row container

Select this option from the Arrange or right click menu when multiple elements are selected to group the elements in a Row container. Learn more about Row containers [here](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/responsive-properties).

Group elements in a Column container

Select this option from the Arrange or right click menu when multiple elements are selected to group the elements in a Column container. Learn more about Column containers [here](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/responsive-properties).

Group elements in an Align-to-Parent container

Select this option from the Arrange or right click menu when multiple elements are selected to group the elements in an Align-to-Parent container. Learn more about Align-to-Parent containers [here](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/responsive-properties).

Apply gap spacing between elements

Check this box to specify gap spacing between child elements in your Row or Column container. If the container has a Row container, you will be able to specify both row-gap and column-gap values. If your container has a Column container layout, you will be able to specify row-gap values. Gap values will move the position of child elements accordingly and reduce the amount of available space to grow within the parent container - if the child elements are variable width or height.

**Note:** Gap controls are supported by newer versions of most browsers with the exception of Internet Explorer. Refer to [this guide](https://caniuse.com/flexbox-gap) to see if your users browsers are supported.

Row gap (px)

Specify a value in pixels. The row gap value defines the vertical distance between rows of child elements in a parent container. In a Row container layout, the row gap value defines a consistent distance between the first row of child elements as elements wrap to the next row. In a Column container layout, the row gap value defines a consistent distance between child elements as they are stacked vertically.

Column gap (px)

Specify a value in pixels. The column gap value defines the horizontal distance between child elements in a parent container and is only available in Row container layouts.

 Conditional formatting

Conditions

You can control how page elements behave and appear under certain circumstances. Define these conditions and the properties to be altered in the Conditional Formatting section in the Property Editor. States are applied in the order listed. If two states are active and modify the same property, the state listed last is the one used.

**Note:** With conditionals, you can create your own input validation, e.g. "This button should not be clickable until the input is at least 3 characters long". Some of these validations are not evaluated on each keystroke, but rather after the user pauses for a second.

**When**

A condition defines when the properties should change. A condition can be about the element itself, e.g., when a button is hovered or clicked or be based on a more complex expression, such as when the user is logged in. Build this expression one condition at a time. As this condition should return yes or no, it will be red until the condition is valid.

**Select a property to change when true**

Select which properties to modify from this dropdown menu when the element meets the condition.

**Move up**

Clicking this button moves the condition up by one. The condition originally above the current condition will be moved down one.

**Move down**

Clicking this moves the condition down by one. The condition originally below the current condition will be moved up by one.

**Remove condition**

Clicking this removes the condition from the current element.

**On/Off**

This button turns the condition on or off in the editor, so that you can preview what different states of the condition look like. The default is off. For more information:

**Can have the slug value**

This operation tests if the argument is a valid slug value for the Thing. A valid slug value is both unique and correctly formatted with only lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens.

**Cannot have the slug value**

This operation tests if the argument is an invalid slug value for the Thing. An invalid slug value is anything that isn’t made up of only lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens or that is not unique.

Transitions

For a smoother effect, transitions change an element's properties over time. For example, define a transition so the background color changes over 500 milliseconds. When the color changes, the element's color will change gradually over 500 milliseconds instead of at one time.

**Note:** Transitions are not applied to gradient backgrounds.

**Duration**

Length of the transition in milliseconds.

**Transition timing dropdown**

This parameter determines how the intermediate values of the transition are calculated. Choose from several curves.

**Select a property to define a new transition**

From the dropdown menu, select the property to apply the transition to.

**Remove the transition**

Click the trash icon to remove the transition. The property will change instantaneously instead of gradually.

 States

States of an element are situations the element can find itself in, such as being hovered or visible.

Built-in states

...'s width

This state returns the width of the element in pixels.

...'s height

This state returns the height of the element in pixels.

**... is hovered**

This is the state when the user directly hovers over the element with the mouse.

**... isn't hovered**

This is the state when the user doesn't hover over the element with the mouse.

**... is pressed**

This is the state when the user clicks the element with the mouse or touches it on a touch device.

**... isn't pressed**

This is the state when the user doesn't click the element with the mouse or doesn't touch it on a touch device.

**... is focused**

This is the state when the input element is focused, and the user can type in it.

**... isn't focused**

This is the state when the input element isn't focused, and the user cannot type in it.

**... is visible**

This is the state when the element is visible.

**... isn't visible**

This is the state when the element is invisible, either directly hidden or contained in a hidden container.

**... is valid**

This is the state when an input has valid content, and therefore whose content can be used in workflows in run mode. You will usually use the following property 'isn't valid' for styling purposes.

**... isn't valid**

This is the state when an input has invalid content. This can happen when: – The input is empty, and 'This input shouldn't be empty' is selected in the Property Editor. – The input isn't empty, but the data entered doesn't fit the type of content. For example, the email address isn't a valid email, the address isn't recognized by Google, or the password doesn't follow the password policy. In this case, affected workflows will not run until the input is valid.

**... isn't clickable**

This is the state when a button cannot be clicked. This can happen when: – The button is manually set to non-clickable in the Property Editor. – The button to trigger a workflow relies on invalid input. In this case, not only will the conditional formatting not apply, but affected workflows will not run until the button is clickable.

**...'s value (input)**

[](https://youtu.be/e7gHkc7MRjk)

Our Academy quick tip on how to use the value operator

This is the content of the input. Normally this is simple type, like a text or number, but it can be more complex if using a dropdown or address.

**... is / isn't checked (checkbox)**

This state is true when the checkbox is / isn't checked.

**...'s password strength**

This returns a value from 0 to 100 representing the strength of the typed password. 100 is the strongest. This option is only available when the input's type of content is 'password'.

**...'s typed text (search box input)**

This returns what the user typed in the search box, if it doesn't match any entry in the dynamic list. The type is text.

...'s place name (search box input)

This returns the place name of the selected address in the search box as a text string. This operator is only available when the the choices style is set to geographic places.

**...'s content (container)**

This state returns the content of a container. The type of this state is the type of content of the container. Control the value of this state through the data source property of the element or workflow actions.

**...'s list (repeating group)**

This state returns the content of a repeating group. The type of this state is a list of the type of content of the repeating group. Control the value of this state through the data source property of the element or the workflow action 'Display list in a repeating group.'

**is loading (repeating group, picture uploader)**

This state is true when the repeating group is loading a new list. It allows you to style other elements if you want to adjust how the page looks when loading the list. Use this to know when a file or picture uploader is in the process of uploading a file.

**...'s page number (repeating group)**

This state gives the current page number of a repeating group displaying a fixed number of cells.

**is first page (repeating group)**

This state is true when a fixed number of cells repeating group is on the first page.

**is first page (repeating group)**

This state is true when a fixed number of cells repeating group is on the last page.

**...'s file size (file and image uploader)**

This state returns the size of the file that is being uploaded.

**...'s upload percentage (file uploader)**

This state returns the percentage (from 0 to 100) of the file uploaded so far.

**...'s current marker (map)**

This state returns the value of the marker the user clicked in a map. The type of this state is the type of content of map.

**...'s center address (map)**

This state returns the address of the center of the map. It updates as soon as the user finishes dragging the map.

...'s zoom level (map)

This state returns the degree to which you are currently zoomed in as a number.

**...'s current event (calendar)**

This state returns the value of the event the user clicked in a calendar. The type of this state is the type of content of calendar.

**...'s current day's events (calendar)**

This state returns the list of events of the day the user clicked in a calendar. The type of this state is a list of the type of content of calendar.

**...'s current day (calendar)**

This state returns the date of the day the user clicked. The type is date.

**...'s current date range (calendar)**

This state returns the range of the current calendar view (the start and end date of the view). The type is date range.

**...'s current slide (slideshow, tinder)**

This state returns the current image shown by these two elements.

**...'s current option (slidable menu)**

This state returns the option the user just clicked in the menu. The type is text.

**... is dragged**

This state is true when a drag/drop group is being dragged.

**... is dragged over**

This state is true when a drop area is being hovered by a dragged group.

**Custom states**

Define custom states for an element, similar to the built-in states hovered, pressed, or focused. These states can then be used in the Conditional section in the Property Editor to change how an element displays or behaves when this state has a particular value. Modifying a state is done through the Workflow action 'Set state.' Custom states are useful when you'd like to save information at an element level instead of in the database. A typical use case is to create a tab system in a group. Define a state 'current tab' for the container, and then change the value of 'current tab' when the user clicks on the different tab buttons. Using Conditional formatting, show or hide elements based on the value of the group's current tab.

**Note:** When a state is set to the value of a search in a workflow, the state's value will actually be the query, not the query response value. Use the ':make static' operator on the search dynamic expression to save the result of the query instead of the search itself.

 Page Element

Watch this video to learn about the Page element

The Page Element is the fundamental element that contains all the other elements.

Type of content

This property defines the type of thing the page should expect. Once set, you can refer to the Current page thing in the Bubble Editor. A typical use case of this feature is to create a profile page. Set the type of content to 'user,' and in each element of this page, you can refer to the Current page user's email, Current page user's picture, etc. If you set a type of content to a page, all links pointing to that page should define a thing to send.

Time zone selection

Overriding timezones in the backend requires that you activate the advanced setting *Enable timezone override controls* in your app's general settings.

Reference: [Application settings: Advanced](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/application-settings/generaadvanced-options)​

Select a type from this dropdown menu to define the timezone type with which you are parsing data. By default, data will be parsed using the client's timezone (Current *User's current timezone*). If needed, you can override this setting by selecting a static timezone as an alternative.

Backup field for readable URL

This page represents a thing of the type defined as Type of content.

If the current page's thing does not have a value for its Slug field then the field chosen here will be displayed in the URL. URLs for things without a value for their Slug field usually look like [example.com/page/1449154312665x293260311940684900](http://example.com/page/1449154312665x293260311940684900).

To make this URL readable, select a field to define what to display in the URL. Usually, it will be a short text field, like a name or title. For example, choosing the field 'location' with a value of 'work,' the URL becomes [example.com/page/work-1449154312665x293260311940684900](http://example.com/page/work-1449154312665x293260311940684900).

Page title

This property defines how the page will be displayed in the browser. It can be dynamic by using the 'Insert dynamic data' button.

This page is a native app

Check this box to build a native app and if you want this page to be the app submitted to the app stores. Clicking this checkbox displays a popup listing tips for building a native app. Note: This feature is in beta.

Native app name

Enter the name of the app to be displayed on the homepage of a user's phone.

Mobile version

To have a specific design for the page when loaded on a mobile device, select a page from this dropdown menu. Because the URL remains the same, this is transparent to the user.

Container Layout

Select the container layout type for the page (Fixed, Align to Parent, Row, or Column). Since the page itself is a container, all child elements on the page will inherit different layout controls depending on your selection. More on this can be found in the [Containers](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/containers) section.

Preset page width

Select a preset width for the page from this dropdown menu so that the page fits the target device, e.g., laptop, mobile, or tablet. Changing the page width or height dimensions in the Bubble Editor changes this setting to 'Custom.'

Width for UI Builder

Set a specific pixel value for the width of the screen while you are building. When designing responsively, this value is used to determine the dimensions of child elements that might rely on having knowledge of the page width. This value can be updated by setting a custom value or selecting a Preset page width.

Title (for SEO / FB)

Enter the title you want social networks to crawl when looking at the page. This title is displayed by Facebook, for instance, when the site is listed. It should be approximately 50–60 characters including spaces. If left blank, the title entered in the SEO & Metatags section in the Settings Tab will be used.

Description (for SEO / FB)

Enter the meta description you want Google to crawl when looking at the page. This description is displayed by Google or Bing when the site is listed. It should be less than 160 characters including spaces. If left blank, the description entered in the SEO & Metatags section in the Settings Tab will be used.

Image (for FB)

Choose a dynamic image for Facebook to display.

Page HTML Header

This feature is available on paid plans. Enter any HTML to include in the Header. For example, Google's or Facebook's tracking code for conversion.

Warning: This is for advanced users only because it could break the page.

Background style

Select a background style from this dropdown menu to apply a backdrop. Choose from None, Flat color, Gradient, Image, and Video.

Background color

Choose the background color for the page.

**Note:** The background color only applies to the page element itself, not the true (browser html) page background. In certain instances, like a [popup](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/containerpopup) that is longer than the page element, this html page background color (default: white) will be exposed. *Coming soon: Ability to set this html background color.*

Gradient style

Choose either Linear or Radial from this dropdown menu.

Gradient direction

Choose the orientation of the gradient from this dropdown menu. Selecting 'Custom' displays a Direction degrees field to set the direction in degrees.

Direction degrees

Enter a number between 0 and 360 for the direction of the gradient.

Gradient shape

Choose Ellipse or Circle from this dropdown menu to define the shape of the gradient.

Gradient base

Select a screen location from this dropdown menu to determine where to base the gradient. Choose from Closest-side, Closest-corner, Farthest-side, and Farthest-corner.

X Center Position (%)

Enter a percentage to offset the gradient from the gradient base horizontally. 50% will center the gradient horizontally.

Y Center Position (%)

Enter a percentage to offset the gradient from the gradient base vertically. 50% will center the gradient vertically.

Starting color

Select the starting color of the gradient.

Ending color

Select the ending color of the gradient.

Intermediate color

Select an optional middle color of the gradient. If the input is empty, no intermediate color will be applied.

Background image

Upload or choose a dynamic image to use for the background. Tip: Use an image from our royalty-free library.

Center the image

Centers the image when the user resizes the browser window.

Make image as wide as parent element

If the parent element is wider than the image selected, the image will automatically resize to cover the entire element.

Repeat the image vertically

Repeat the image vertically if the image is smaller than the page's height.

Repeat the image horizontally

Repeat the image horizontally if the image is narrower than the page's width.

Background color if empty

When using a dynamic image, it may take a few milliseconds for the image to load. This color displays until the image loads. The default is transparent.

Apply a parallax effect (desktop only)

Check this box to scroll the background image more slowly than the elements on the page. This gives an impression of depth.

Parallax speed

Choose a number from this dropdown menu to control the depth effect of the parallax. With a value of 0, the image will not scroll. With a value of 1, the image will scroll at the same speed as the elements.

Video file

Upload an mp4 file or choose a dynamic video to use for the background.

Fallback image

On mobile devices, videos are not displayed due to data usage limit concerns. Upload an image to use in this case.

Play video silent

Check this box to show the video without sound.

Stripes (deprecated)

Define screen-wide stripes for the page.

Enter any HTML to include in the Header. For example, Google's or Facebook's tracking code for conversion. Warning: This is for advanced users only because it could break the page.

Background style

Select a background style from this dropdown menu to apply a backdrop. Choose from None, Flat color, Gradient, Image, and Video.

Background color

Choose the background color for the page.

**Note:** The background color only applies to the page element itself, not the true (browser html) page background. In certain instances, like a [popup](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/containerpopup) that is longer than the page element, this html page background color (default: white) will be exposed. *Coming soon: Ability to set this html background color.*

Gradient style

Choose either Linear or Radial from this dropdown menu.

Gradient direction

Choose the orientation of the gradient from this dropdown menu. Selecting 'Custom' displays a Direction degrees field to set the direction in degrees.

Direction degrees

Enter a number between 0 and 360 for the direction of the gradient.

Gradient shape

Choose Ellipse or Circle from this dropdown menu to define the shape of the gradient.

Gradient base

Select a screen location from this dropdown menu to determine where to base the gradient. Choose from Closest-side, Closest-corner, Farthest-side, and Farthest-corner.

X Center Position (%)

Enter a percentage to offset the gradient from the gradient base horizontally. 50% will center the gradient horizontally.

Center the image

Centers the image when the user resizes the browser window.

Make image as wide as parent element

If the parent element is wider than the image selected, the image will automatically resize to cover the entire element.

Repeat the image vertically

Repeat the image vertically if the image is smaller than the page's height.

Repeat the image horizontally

Repeat the image horizontally if the image is narrower than the page's width.

Background color if empty

When using a dynamic image, it may take a few milliseconds for the image to load. This color displays until the image loads. The default is transparent.

Apply a parallax effect (desktop only)

Check this box to scroll the background image more slowly than the elements on the page. This gives an impression of depth.

Parallax speed

Choose a number from this dropdown menu to control the depth effect of the parallax. With a value of 0, the image will not scroll. With a value of 1, the image will scroll at the same speed as the elements.

Video file

Upload an mp4 file or choose a dynamic video to use for the background.

Fallback image

On mobile devices, videos are not displayed due to data usage limit concerns. Upload an image to use in this case.

Play video silent

Check this box to show the video without sound.

Stripes (deprecated)

 Visual Elements

Text Element

Watch this video to learn more about the Text Element

A text element displays static or dynamic text. It can also trigger a workflow with a click.

Text

This is the content to display in the text element. Enter static text or use the 'Insert dynamic data' button to enter dynamic text. In the dynamic case, create the expression to be rendered in run-mode piece by piece. It can be, for instance, 'Current user's first name.'

Use the Rich text editor to format parts of the text differently from the main element style. Use bb-code to add richer content like a link.

**Tip:** Certain BBCode tags have limited or no ability for you to adjust the size of the resulting embedded item (example: [youtube]). Of special note is [image], which allows setting fixed dimensions but not maximum dimensions. For finer control over items embedded in text, consider using an HTML element instead (not safe for end users to enter contents though)

Canvas placeholder

The canvas placeholder field allows you to display a preview text, making it easier to visualize the content of an element while designing your app. The text is only visible in the editor and will not be shown to your app's users.

Cut off content if the element is not tall enough

When checked, the text element will truncate the text and add '...' to the end of the text. This option applies to Responsive mode. If line height is smaller than available content area, then all text will be cut off and the element will be blank.

**Note:** In the specific situation of a) a text element having height just tall enough to accommodate the contents, b) that element having "Cut off content if the element is not tall enough" and c) a user seeing that element on Firefox, that element can sometimes not be visible because the height is too close to the height of the text. To avoid this, try making the text element slightly taller.

Shrink the element height if the text gets shorter

When checked, the text element will adjust its height when the text changes, such as a font size change, even if the new height is lower than the original height set in the Bubble Editor. If this box is checked and the element is invisible, its height will be set to zero.

Stretch to fit content (non-responsive mode)

This option automatically resizes the text element when the content becomes longer. The elements on the page that are below the text are automatically pushed down to make room for the resized text.

Do not apply bb-code

By default, text elements apply bb-code to let you use advanced formatting and links in texts. If you do not want this to happen, for instance because the text displays user-generated texts, check this box.

Recognize links and emails

When checked, this option will automatically convert URLs and email addresses in the text into clickable links in run mode. Note that if the element is set not to apply bb-code and if the text has some bb-code tags, links will not be recognized.

Link color

When the text element is set to detect links and email, you can optionally pick to color the links in a different color.

Mark the links as nofollow

When the text element is set to detect links, you can optionally make them not endorse the source (for SEO purposes).

HTML tag for this element (SEO)

Checking the 'Expose the type of tags for text elements' checkbox in the SEO & Metatags section in the Settings Tab allows you to select an HTML tag to be applied to this element. Select the tag in the Style Tab. Use this option for SEO optimization.

Start/Edit workflow

Click this button to create a new workflow triggered by this element. The type of event depends on the element and is generally the most common event. For example, buttons will create a 'When this element is clicked...' event. If a workflow already exists, this takes you to the existing workflow in the Workflow Tab. To create a different type of event or create a second event, go to the Workflow Tab and click the 'Click here to add an event...' button.

This element isn't clickable

When checked, the element will not trigger a workflow when clicked nor will the user's cursor change to a pointer when they hover over the element. In addition, the item will display according to any specified conditional formatting for the 'isn't clickable' state. This can be used to stop a user from moving forward in a flow until some condition is true. For example, we might disable a specific action until the user is logged in. 'This input should not be empty' can also be used to prevent the user from clicking.

**Note:** If a text element is narrow, words which are longer than that element will not automatically line break. If your text element needs to accommodate long words (especially in certain languages), consider making the element wider.

Similarly, if you try to rotate a narrow text element, the result may be different than what you expect. To fix this, give the rotated element a greater width.

Image

Watch this video to learn more about the Image element

An image displays an uploaded static image or dynamic image.

**Note:** For performance reasons, the Bubble run-mode engine pre-loads all images it can find in your app, including those that are conditionally visible. If your app contains images from password-protected sources, a password prompt may appear while your app loads due to this pre-loading logic. Consider using images from a public source or using the file uploader and conditions to make an image private.

Image source

This defines which image to display. Click Upload to select a file. The image will be resized to the element's dimensions. Clicking the 'Search for free images' button displays a popup to search for royalty-free images. For dynamic images, use the 'Dynamic image' box and click 'Insert dynamic data.' Then, create an expression to return the image in Live mode. For example, 'Current user's profile picture.'

**Tip:** We also offer partial compatibility for PDFs displayed in an image element. If the PDF is public, the browser will compress the PDF to create a thumbnail to view in the image element. Most browsers will bypass this for private files, however, and not display a thumbnail for a private file in an image element. Safari is the exception here and will compress private files to display a thumbnail.

Canvas placeholder

The canvas placeholder field enables you to upload a preview image, making it easier to visualize and understand the appearance of an element while designing your app. This image is only visible in the editor and will not be shown to your app's users.

Run-mode rendering

This option defines how to handle dynamic images if their size doesn't exactly fit the current element. Choose from:

- Stretch: The image will be resized to fill the entire element. If the image and the element have different proportions, the image will be stretched and might look distorted.
- Rescale: The image will be resized to fit inside the element. If the image and the element have different proportions, the parts of the element area that the image doesn't cover will be left blank. This is the best option for profile pictures.
- Zoom: The image will be zoomed in until it can cover the element's whole area. If the image and the element have different proportions, the parts of the image that don't fit inside the element may be cut off.
- Adjust element height: The image will be resized to be the same width as the element, keeping its proportions intact. If the image and the element have different proportions, the element's height will grow to fit the whole image, and elements below it will be pushed down to make room.

Cropping tool

Click this button to crop a static image.

ALT tag

For SEO purposes, add an ALT tag to an image. It specifies alternate text for an image if the image cannot be displayed. The ALT attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it, e.g., slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader. Note: This option is accessible when 'Expose the type of tags for text elements' is checked in the SEO & Metatags section in the Settings Tab.

Start/Edit workflow

Click this button to create a new workflow triggered by this element. The type of event depends on the element and is generally the most common event. For example, buttons will create a 'When this element is clicked...' event. If a workflow already exists, this takes you to the existing workflow in the Workflow Tab. To create a different type of event or create a second event, go to the Workflow Tab and click the 'Click here to add an event...' button.

This element isn't clickable

When checked, the element will not trigger a workflow when clicked nor will the user's cursor change to a pointer when they hover over the element. In addition, the item will display according to any specified conditional formatting for the 'isn't clickable' state. This can be used to stop a user from moving forward in a flow until some condition is true. For example, we might disable a specific action until the user is logged in. 'This input should not be empty' can also be used to prevent the user from clicking.

**Note:** If you have an image element of a certain width that's trying to display a large horizontal image, it may overflow to the right if you do not change the cropping settings.

Button

Watch this video to learn more about the Button Element

A button is an element a user can click to trigger a workflow.

Text

This is the content to display in the button element. Enter static text or use the 'Insert dynamic data' button to enter dynamic text. In the dynamic case, create the expression to be rendered in run-mode piece by piece. It can be, for instance, 'Current user's first name.'

'This input should not be empty' can also be used to prevent the user from clicking.

Link

Watch this video to learn more about using the Link Element

A link is a special element that takes the user to another page within the app or website. It has the same properties as links on a web page, meaning users can right-click them, open them in a new tab, copy them.

Show an icon instead of text

Check this box to display an icon instead of text. Choose an icon from the Font Awesome library.

Text

This is the content to display. Enter static text or use the 'Insert dynamic data' button to enter dynamic text. In the dynamic case, create the expression to be rendered in run-mode piece by piece. It can be, for instance, 'Current user's profile page.'

Icon

Choose the icon to use for this link. Control the color and size of the icon with the text color and size properties.

Link destination

Choose either Internal page or External URL from this dropdown menu. Internal page takes the user to another page in the app. External URL takes the user to a different website.

Destination page

Select which page the link should go to.

Data to send

Define what data should be sent to the linked page. This data should be of the type of content of the destination page. If you're building a profile page which has the type of content 'user,' send a user to that page. The Composer will be red until the type of data is the proper type. If the page doesn't have a type, you can send text instead to append a path to the URL.

Destination URL

Enter the URL the link should go to. Use the 'Insert dynamic data' button to enter dynamic text.

Open in a new tab

Check this box to open the link in a new browser tab. Use this option to keep users in the app.

Disabled clicking on the link

Check this box to make the link unclickable. Use this option to disable and enable links dynamically.

Mark the link as nofollow

Check this box if you do not endorse the link (for SEO purposes).

Send more parameters to the page

Use this checkbox to send additional data to a page that is not a thing. This can be text, a number for a search, etc. This option defines the series of keys and values to send. The way to use them in the destination page is by using the 'Get data from page URL' data source.

Additional parameters

Enter the keys and values to send to the destination page. Warning: Because of Bubble's internal logic, do not use 'id,' 'debug_mode,' or 'resume' as keys.

Send current page parameters

If there is any data stored in the page URL parameters when the page changes the parameters will be carried over to the destination page as well. These parameters will be overridden by any parameters with the same name added using the "Send more parameters to the page" option.

Wrap the text when the width changes

Check this box if you want the link to be on more than one line when the page width becomes smaller.

Icon

Watch this video to learn more about the Icon Element

This element is a way to use one of the free icons from the Font Awesome library.

Icon

Click this button to open the icon library and choose an icon. Search to refine the list.

Icon color

Select the color for the icon.

Make the icon rotate

Check this box to continuously rotate the icon.

Start/Edit workflow

Click this button to create a new workflow triggered by this element. The type of event depends on the element and is generally the most common event. For example, buttons will create a 'When this element is clicked...' event. If a workflow already exists, this takes you to the existing workflow in the Workflow Tab. To create a different type of event or create a second event, go to the Workflow Tab and click the 'Click here to add an event...' button.

In addition, the item will display according to any specified conditional formatting for the 'isn't clickable' state. This can be used to stop a user from moving forward in a flow until some condition is true. For example, we might disable a specific action until the user is logged in. 'This input should not be empty' can also be used to prevent the user from clicking.

Shape

Watch this video to learn more about the Shape Element

A shape element is typically used for visual purposes, but it can also trigger a workflow when the user clicks it.

Start/Edit workflow

Click this button to create a new workflow triggered by this element. The type of event depends on the element and is generally the most common event. For example, buttons will create a 'When this element is clicked...' event. If a workflow already exists, this takes you to the existing workflow in the Workflow Tab. To create a different type of event or create a second event, go to the Workflow Tab and click the 'Click here to add an event...' button.

This can be used to stop a user from moving forward in a flow until some condition is true. For example, we might disable a specific action until the user is logged in. 'This input should not be empty' can also be used to prevent the user from clicking.

Video

This element displays a YouTube or Vimeo player on the page. It can be a static or dynamic video. Ziggeo is also supported when the plugin is installed.

**Tip:** The Bubble engine does not have access to play/paused states for an embedded video. As long as a video has started, it will not stop by itself, even if the container is hidden. To force a video to stop playing if the group containing the video is hidden, consider using conditional states to change the video ID to null when the container is hidden.

Video source

Select the video's hosting service: YouTube or Vimeo. Ziggeo is also supported when the plugin is installed.

**Tip:** If cookies are opt-in for your Bubble application, your users will need to consent for a YouTube video to load.

Video ID

Enter the ID of the video to run in the player. It's usually the ID shown in the URL when watching this video on YouTube or Vimeo. It can be a dynamic ID.

Play the video automatically on load

If this checkbox is selected, the video automatically plays when the page loads.

Replay video when over

Plays the video in a continuous loop.

Video control color

Select the color of the video player for Vimeo. YouTube does not offer this option.

Server authentication token

Sets a server authentication token for Ziggeo videos to control access. Ziggeo is supported when the plugin is installed.

Map

Watch this video to learn how to use the Map element

This element displays a single address or list of addresses on a map. It is powered by Google Maps.

Number of markers

A map can either display: – None: In this case, the map has no markers. – Single: The map centers this address in the map. This address can be static or dynamic. – List: The map displays a list of addresses and zooms to display the entire list. In this case, the list comes from the application database.

Type of markers

When the map is set to display a list of dynamic entries, define the type of things to be displayed on the map. It can be users, apartments, etc.

Data source

Define which address to display on the map. When the map is set to Single marker, it should either be a static entry, like an address, or a dynamic entry of the type geographic address. When the map is set to List of markers, the data source should be a list of geographic addresses. The Composer will be red until the list is of the correct type. It's generally going to be the result of a search.

Address field

When using a dynamic list to define the list to display, you must define which field contains the address. For example, if a type of thing is 'Apartment,' the field might be 'Address.' This field should be of type geographic address.

Show title window

Choose from No, On click, and Always in this dropdown menu to determine when to show the title. When No is selected, the title never displays. When On click is selected, the title shows only when the marker is clicked. When Always is selected, the title always displays.

Marker caption

When using title windows, define the text to display. When building this expression, you can refer to the current marker. That is, the marker for the current box.

Auto-close window when another is clicked on

When this box is checked, the map will automatically close all title windows before displaying a new one when the user clicks on a marker.

Map type

This option defines the type of map to display, based on Google's types: Roadmap, Hybrid, Satellite, and Terrain.

Map style

Select a visual style for the map from this dropdown menu or create a custom map style. This is only for display purposes.

Custom style (JSON object)

This lets you copy-paste (or build your own!) map style. This must be a parsable JSON object. Visit [snazzymaps.com](https://snazzymaps.com/) for examples.

Allow zooming and dragging

When selected, the user can zoom and drag. When unchecked, the map will behave like a static map.

Disable zooming on scroll

Check this box to prevent the map from zooming when the user scrolls over it.

Set center and zoom manually

When using List markers, the map automatically scales so that all markers are shown. To force a center and a zoom, check this box.

Map centered on

When using List markers, the map is centered so that all markers are shown, but you can force a center with this field. With a Single marker, the map is centered on the address.

Initial zoom

Defines the initial zoom used when the map loads.

Use customized marker icon

This option uploads a customized icon instead of using the Google icon.

Customized icon

When using the map with a list of markers, select from No, Upload custom, and Data dependent from this dropdown menu. When No is selected, no custom icon will be used. When Upload custom is selected, upload an image to use as an icon for all the markers. When Data dependent is selected, each marker will use a unique icon, which must be stored in the application database.

Customized icon

Use this field to upload a customized image to use as the marker.

Icon field

If you're using a list of markers and set the marker to be Data dependent and coming from the database, define the field that contains the image. The field should be of type image.

Custom selected icon

When working with a list of map markers, you can optionally change the marker image for the currently selected marker. This makes it easy to see which marker the user has clicked on or selected. Choose 'upload custom' to pick an image to use. If you want to use a different image for different map markers, select 'Data dependent' and you will have an option to pick an image field on the marker to use for selections.

Selected icon

Only visible if 'Custom selected icon' is set to 'upload custom'. This lets you upload an image to use as the marker icon for the selected marker.

Selected icon field

Only visible if 'Custom selected icon' is set to 'Data dependent'. Lets you pick an image field on the type of marker data you are displaying to use for the selected map marker: the image in that field will be displayed when the user clicks on the marker.

Alert

An alert displays a temporary message on the page, like a warning. It is displayed with a fade in and fade out animation. Show it through a workflow action.

Our Academy quick tip on how to use alerts

Text

This is the content to display in the alert. Enter static text or use the 'Insert dynamic data' button to enter dynamic text. In the dynamic case, create the expression to be rendered in run-mode piece by piece. It can be, for instance, 'Current user's first name.' This content can be modified directly by the action that shows the alert. In this case, the text defined at the element level is overwritten.

Position the alert at the top

Check this option to float the alert at the top of the page and be as wide as the entire page area. If checked, this means that the responsive settings won't apply, and the alert will not affect the responsive behavior of your page.

HTML Element

Watch this video to learn more about The HTML Element

This element runs HTML on the page, for instance to render elements. Some services provide embeddable HTML code to put on a page.

HTML

Paste the actual HTML to be rendered by the element. If the HTML contains script tags, the script tags will only run in run-mode and not in the editor. Customize the content of the HTML with dynamic data, if needed, by inserting dynamic entries with the 'Insert dynamic data' button.

Display as an iFrame

Check this box if the HTML should run as if it was an independent web page. Refer to the code provider to decide if this is a relevant option.

Stretch to fit content

When not in iFrame mode and this option is checked, the HTML element will resize automatically if the content is longer than the element. Elements under the resized HTML element will be pushed down automatically.

Built on Bubble

This element adds an icon or the text 'Built without code on Bubble.' Clicking it displays Bubble's homepage in a new browser tab. While it's not mandatory to put it in the app, we'd really appreciate your help in spreading the word about Bubble :)

**Note:** Some browser extensions can tamper with the Bubble banner or make Bubble think the banner isn't there, prompting a reminder about it.

Visual type

Choose from Blue, Gray, White, and Text from this dropdown menu. Selecting a color option will display the text of the Bubble logo in that color. Selecting Text will display 'Built without code on Bubble' instead of an icon.

Add a border

Check this box to add a border around the logo or text.

Text color

Customize the text color with this property.

 Containers

Group

Groups are elements that contain other elements. A group has two roles. First, a group gathers elements from a visual perspective, and all the elements in that group move together. It also has a semantic significance. A group can have data injected into it, and the elements inside the group can refer to the Parent group's thing. For example, you can 'display' a user in a group, and all elements inside that group will be able to display the 'Parent group's user's email.' Use this functionality when you want some areas of the app's page to display items relative to a dynamic entry.

[](https://youtu.be/HWmgmzIQRfg)

Our Academy quick tip on how to group elements together

Container layout

A Group's container layout defines it's and it's child elements responsive behavior. See more in [Container Layout Types.](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/container-layout-types)​

Type of content

This allows you to select the type of thing this container displays. Most elements that have this property also have a Data source property, which lets you select the displayed thing or list of things. The value of the data source must match the selected type of content. Let's look at an example of a map with hotels marked. When you click a marker, a popup displays with the name of the hotel. The Type of content would be 'Hotel' and the Data source would be 'Map's current marker.'

Data source

Define the thing or list of things that should be displayed in this container. For example, in groups or popups, only a single thing will display, but for repeating groups a list of things will display. Child elements can access the Data source from their parent. If the parent contains a list of things, the child has access to the individual list items. A common scenario for groups is to display something, like the current user, and then have the group contain the inputs that modify the user's properties, such as text and images that display information about the user. The Type of content determines what kind of thing you are allowed to set in the Data source field. If the type of thing does not match the Data source, it will be marked as an issue, and you must change one or the other to match. The Data source can come from anywhere in Bubble. For example, it could be the result of a search, a custom or built-in Data source, or it could be dynamic and come from the user. The Data source will update when its source changes. For example, if the search result changes because a user modified some data used in the search constraints, the displayed list will automatically change. For additional flexibility, you can update the Data source in the Conditional Formatting Tab in the Property Editor. Finally, the Data source property can be modified by workflows. Changes made by actions override whatever you specify as the Data source directly or as a conditional state until you run a reset action, which then restores the original setting.

**Note:** As mentioned, Groups can have data assigned to them (e.g. 'this group should show data about user X'). When the data assigned to a group changes, the group will reset all the input fields within itself.

This is useful when the input fields are supposed to change depending on the group's data. But, it can also cause confusion, for example, when a group's data depends on an input that's inside that group!

Collapse when hidden

By default, hiding an element leaves a blank space on the page, exposing whatever is underneath it. When you select this option, however, the elements below the hidden element are pulled upward to fill the space.

**Tip:** A common pattern for a messaging UI involves a Repeating Group where cells have two Groups (Sender & Receiver) that display the text sent by each respective party. When the message belongs to the Sender, the Receiver group is hidden and vice versa.

Because of a race condition between evaluating conditional visibility of groups in Repeating Group cells and evaluating cell height, blank spaces may appear when switching between the two groups when a new message is sent.

To minimize the risk of this happening, consider enabling "Collapse this element's height when hidden" on both Groups.

Animate the collapse operation

This option is only visible if 'Collapse this element's height when hidden' is selected. By default, elements collapse and expand instantly, but this option animates with either Fade In/Out or Slide Up/Down.

Animation style

This option allows you to choose whether an element's animation will Fade In/Out or Slide Up/Down.

**Note:** Animation Style is not currently supported for use on a group in situations where a repeating group's underlying data is changing. In these situations, consider relying on the repeating group's built-in updating instead of adding an animation.

Start/Edit workflow

Click this button to create a new workflow triggered by this element. The type of event depends on the element and is generally the most common event. For example, buttons will create a 'When this element is clicked...' event. If a workflow already exists, this takes you to the existing workflow in the Workflow Tab. To create a different type of event or create a second event, go to the Workflow Tab and click the 'Click here to add an event...' button.

This element isn't clickable

When checked, the element will not trigger a workflow when clicked nor will the user's cursor change to a pointer when they hover over the element. In addition, the item will display according to any specified conditional formatting for the 'isn't clickable' state. This can be used to stop a user from moving forward in a flow until some condition is true. For example, we might disable a specific action until the user is logged in. 'This input should not be empty' can also be used to prevent the user from clicking.

**Tip:** Conditionally changing the borders of a Group will not resize the content in the group, which can lead to undesirable formatting. Consider using two groups (one without a border), and toggling between the two if this behavior is desired.

Repeating Group

For a more in-depth look at repeating groups, read our dedicated Manual article on the subject:

Article: [Repeating groups](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers/repeating-groups)​

A repeating group displays lists of things, either coming from the application database or from APIs. Design the first cell, and the remaining cells will follow that design.

Type of content

This allows you to select the type of thing this container displays. Most elements that have this property also have a Data source property, which lets you select the displayed thing or list of things. The value of the data source must match the selected type of content. Let's look at an example of a map with hotels marked. When you click a marker, a popup displays with the name of the hotel. The Type of content would be 'Hotel' and the Data source would be 'Map's current marker.'

Data source

This is the list of things to display in the group. It can either be

- The result of a search using 'Do a search for,'
- The content of a field whose type is list of things, or
- The result of an API call through the 'Get data from an external API.'

Once this is set, each cell will display one thing, and the elements drawn inside the cell will be able to refer to the 'Current cell's thing.'

**Note:** Avoid the situation where you automatically change the data source of a repeating group based on a condition that references the repeating group itself! This will cause an infinite loop and the repeating group will not behave as you expect.

Layout settings

Fixed of rows or columns

Check fixed number of rows or column if you'd like to display a fixed number of rows or columns in run mode, regardless of the screen size or number of entries in the List. Check both boxes to recreate the legacy Fixed number of cells repeating group layout.

​

Set fixed number of rows

Check this box to have the repeating group show a fixed number of rows. Cell height will be determined by the height of the overall repeating group container divided by the number of rows specified. Use the show next / show previous workflow actions to paginate the table and show more data.

Rows

Set the number of rows you’d like to display.

Set fixed number of columns

Check this box to have the repeating group show a fixed number of columns. Cell width will be determined by the width of the overall repeating group container divided by the number of columns specified. Use the show next / how previous workflow actions to show more data.

Columns

Set the number of columns you’d like to display.

Show partial list on last page if needed

Check this box to show a less than specified number of rows or columns on the last page of a paginated table if needed.

**Dynamic of rows or columns**

Uncheck fixed number of rows or column if you'd like to display a dynamic number of rows or columns in run mode - i.e. to recreate legacy vertical scrolling or horizontal scrolling repeating group layouts.

Scrollbars, especially when in repeating groups, can sometimes cause elements to appear slightly different than designed on certain browsers and devices. This is because Bubble relies on the end-user's operating system and browser to determine how a scrollbar should look.

​

Min height of row

Specify a minimum Repeating Group row height. The Repeating Group will default to filling as many cells as the data allows at the minimum height, and then grow in size evenly to fill the remaining space.

For example, if you have a repeating group with a height of 440px, a min height of 100px, and 5 entries in your List, the repeating group in run-mode will initially show 4 cells at a height of 110px each.

Stretch rows to fill vertical space

If [Set fixed number of rows](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/containerset-fixed-number-of-rows) is unchecked, choose whether to stretch rows to fill vertical space. If rows at min height aren't tall enough to fill vertical space, each row will stretch in height to do so.

If this setting is checked, the Display items as masonry grid option will not be available since that setting requires elements to fit height to their content.

Min width of column

Specify a minimum Repeating Group column width. The Repeating Group will default to filling as many cells as the Repeating Group Container width allows at the minimum cell width, and then grow in size evenly to fill the remaining space.

For example, if you have a repeating group with a width of 440px, a min width of 200px, and 10 entries, the repeating group in run-mode will initially show a repeating group with 2 columns at a width of 220px each.

Stretch columns to fill horizontal space

If [Set fixed number of columns](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/containerset-fixed-number-of-columns) is unchecked, choose whether to stretch columns to fill horizontal space. If columns at min width aren't wide enough to fill horizontal space, each column will stretch in width to do so.

If this setting is unchecked, the amount of data that is loaded will not impact the number of columns rendered on the page. For example, if 6 columns are able to fit within the Repeating Group container, but there are only two pieces of data in the List, 6 columns will still be rendered. On the other hand, if this setting is checked, the two columns with data will stretch to fit the amount of space available.

Scroll direction

If [Set fixed number of rows](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/containerset-fixed-number-of-rows) and [Set fixed number of columns](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/containerset-fixed-number-of-columns) are both unchecked, choose the direction you’d like the repeating group to scroll.

Vertical

Select this option if you'd like your repeating group to scroll vertically if the amount of rows takes up more space than the parent container allows. This is usually the most common option.

Horizontal

Select this option if you'd like your repeating group to scroll horizontally if the amount of rows takes up more space than the parent container allows.

Wrapped horizontally

Select this option if you'd like the items in your repeating group to wrap to a new row if the number of items takes up more space than the parent container allows. Use this setting if you'd like to create a "tag" like list where columns fit width to their content and do not need to be evenly sized.

This option has access to [Row gap](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/responsive-propertierow-gap-px) and [Column gap](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/responsive-propertiecolumn-gap-px) settings.

Show all items immediately

Check this box to load all of the data right away. This is similar to legacy Full List repeating group behavior.

Display items as masonry grid

Check this box to display the data in your repeating group as a "pinterest style" grid. The masonry grid setting allows each cell to take up only as much space as needed in each column's row, as opposed to requiring a fixed row height across all columns like normal repeating group tables. This setting is only available when [Set fixed number of rows](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/containerset-fixed-number-of-rows) is unchecked.

If this setting is checked, the [Stretch rows to fill vertical space](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/containerstretch-rows-to-fit) option will not be available since this setting requires elements to fit height to their content.

Container layout type

A repeating group cell is a container as well and can have one of the following 4 container layout types: [Fixed](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/container-layout-typefixed), [Align to parent](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/container-layout-typealign-to-parent), [Row](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/container-layout-typerow), and [Column](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/container-layout-typecolumn). Select the appropriate container layout type depending on what child element behavior you want.

Separator Style

Select the type of border to display between the cells. Choose from None or a stylized line, such as Solid, Dashed, and Double.

Separator Width

Enter the width to apply to the separator in pixels. Set a width even with a separator of None. In this case, the cells will have some empty space between them.

Separator Color

Select the separator color.

Start/Edit workflow

Click this button to create a new workflow triggered by this element. The type of event depends on the element and is generally the most common event. For example, buttons will create a 'When this element is clicked...' event. If a workflow already exists, this takes you to the existing workflow in the Workflow Tab. To create a different type of event or create a second event, go to the Workflow Tab and click the 'Click here to add an event...' button.

This element isn't clickable

When checked, the element will not trigger a workflow when clicked nor will the user's cursor change to a pointer when they hover over the element. In addition, the item will display according to any specified conditional formatting for the 'isn't clickable' state. This can be used to stop a user from moving forward in a flow until some condition is true. For example, we might disable a specific action until the user is logged in. 'This input should not be empty' can also be used to prevent the user from clicking.

Table element

For a more in-depth look at the table element, read our dedicated Manual article on the subject:

Article: [The table element](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/elements/containers/table-elements)​

Table element

Type of content

This allows you to select the data type this container displays, such as User.

Data source

The table element expects a list of things to be returned. Each cell of the table element’s repeating rows can then refer to the Current cell’s thing.

Table direction

This property determines whether the content of the table is loaded vertically (along the Y-axis) or horizontally (along the X-axis). The setting affects both static and repeating rows/columns)

Vertical and horizontal separators

This property lets you enable and set the styling options for the vertical and horizontal separators. Note that these settings can be affected by the [*Table direction*](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/containertable-direction) setting.

Static rows/columns

Note: Whether the settings below are applied to rows or columns depends on the Table orientation setting on the table element.

Make this row/column sticky

This property enables the row to be fixed at the top of the element, ensuring it stays visible as you scroll through the rows below. This is particularly useful for keeping headers or key information in sight while navigating extensive data sets.

Repeating rows/columns

Set fixed number of repeating rows/columns

This property instructs Bubble to only display a set number of repeating rows in the table. Checking it will reveal the setting below to set the number of rows.

Row/column count

This property sets the maximum number of rows that you want to display. If the data source contains a list that is shorter than the maximum number of rows set, Bubble will only display the number of rows equal to the length of the list.

When working with the table element, the **contextual menu** offers a lot of different options for managing table rows and columns. You can read more about this in the reference entry for the contextual menu.

Working with the table element introduces a lot of new options to Bubble's **contextual menu**. You can see a list of all of these options in the contextual menu reference entry.

Reference: [Contextual menu](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/bubbles-interface/top-and-context-menu-optioncut-column) (table element entries)

Popup

Popups are hidden from the user until you display them from the Workflow Tab. When they are visible, they are fixed position in the center of the viewport. If the popup is longer than the viewport, the user will be able to scroll to see the full content. If the popup is shorter than the viewport, the user will not be able to scroll.

[](https://youtu.be/YXxYeHlowWk)

Our Academy quick tip on how to use popups

**Tip:** If the popup is longer than the viewport, scrolling will be enabled, and scroll distance is tied to the length of the page in the background. If you have a very long page, the user will be able to continue scrolling the entire length of the background page, potentially past the point where the popup is no longer visible.

Type of content

This allows you to select the type of thing this container displays. Most elements that have this property also have a Data source property, which lets you select the displayed thing or list of things. The value of the data source must match the selected type of content. Let's look at an example of a map with hotels marked. When you click a marker, a popup displays with the name of the hotel. The Type of content would be 'Hotel' and the Data source would be 'Map's current marker.'

Data source

Define the thing or list of things that should be displayed in this container. For example, in groups or popups, only a single thing will display, but for repeating groups a list of things will display. Child elements can access the Data source from their parent. If the parent contains a list of things, the child has access to the individual list items. A common scenario for groups is to display something, like the current user, and then have the group contain the inputs that modify the user's properties, such as text and images that display information about the user. The Type of content determines what kind of thing you are allowed to set in the Data source field. If the type of thing does not match the Data source, it will be marked as an issue, and you must change one or the other to match. The Data source can come from anywhere in Bubble. For example, it could be the result of a search, a custom or built-in Data source, or it could be dynamic and come from the user. The Data source will update when its source changes. For example, if the search result changes because a user modified some data used in the search constraints, the displayed list will automatically change. For additional flexibility, you can update the Data source in the Conditional Formatting Tab in the Property Editor. Finally, the Data source property can be modified by workflows. Changes made by actions override whatever you specify as the Data source directly or as a conditional state until you run a reset action, which then restores the original setting.

This popup can't be closed by pressing 'Esc'

By default, popups can be closed by the user when pressing Esc. To disable this behavior and make the popup modal, check this box. In this case, the only way to close the popup is with a Hide Popup action in a workflow.

Grayout color

Select the color of the background when a popup is open. By default, it is set to a dark transparent layer.

Grayout blur

Enter a number greater than 0 to set a blur effect on the background. While this offers an interesting design, the display speed of the popup may be affected.

Start/Edit workflow

Click this button to create a new workflow triggered by this element. The type of event depends on the element and is generally the most common event. For example, buttons will create a 'When this element is clicked...' event. If a workflow already exists, this takes you to the existing workflow in the Workflow Tab. To create a different type of event or create a second event, go to the Workflow Tab and click the 'Click here to add an event...' button.

This element isn't clickable

When checked, the element will not trigger a workflow when clicked nor will the user's cursor change to a pointer when they hover over the element. In addition, the item will display according to any specified conditional formatting for the 'isn't clickable' state. This can be used to stop a user from moving forward in a flow until some condition is true. For example, we might disable a specific action until the user is logged in. 'This input should not be empty' can also be used to prevent the user from clicking.

Floating Group

[](https://youtu.be/lvuovDbPsHg)

Watch our Academy quick tip on how to set up a floating group

Floating groups are groups that float on the screen on top of the page but are not contained within the page. These are useful to keep an element in the same place on the screen regardless of the scrolling position of the page or the visibility of groups within the page. Floating groups are useful for headers, buttons like 'Scroll to top,' etc.

Type of content

This allows you to select the type of thing this container displays. Most elements that have this property also have a Data source property, which lets you select the displayed thing or list of things. The value of the data source must match the selected type of content. Let's look at an example of a map with hotels marked. When you click a marker, a popup displays with the name of the hotel. The Type of content would be 'Hotel' and the Data source would be 'Map's current marker.'

Changes made by actions override whatever you specify as the Data source directly or as a conditional state until you run a reset action, which then restores the original setting.

Vertically float relative to

Using this dropdown menu, choose the base to calculate the position of the floating group. Choose from: – Top: The distance between the top edge of the group and the top of the user's screen remains constant, no matter the scrolling position of the page. This is the default. – Bottom: The distance between the bottom of the group and the user's screen remains constant no matter the scrolling position of the page. – Both: Both the top and bottom distances will remain constant, and a scrollbar will appear if the group is too short to show all its content. – Nothing: The floating group will not float, meaning that it behaves like a regular group. For example, the distance is calculated as the height between the top edge of the floating group and the top of the Bubble page. Then, it displays the floating group that distance from the top of the user's screen. Note: By placing the floating group high on the page and making it float relative to the bottom, the element may be 'above' the top of the screen and not display.

Horizontally float relative to

Use this dropdown menu to determine whether the element floats relative to the Right or Left. Right and Left refer to the horizontal edges of the page. This option is less common than vertical reference, but it is useful when you want an element to display no matter the page width.

Floating zindex

Floating groups can be above other elements or beneath the page, and then be used as a background design option. Note that when a floating element is beneath elements, it will only visible if the page background is transparent

Parallax effect factor

When a floating group is beneath the page, you can apply a parallax effect to give some depth to the page. A factor of 1 will remove any parallax effect, while a factor of 0 will keep the element fixed, and a factor of 2 will make the element move twice faster than the scrolling position. A negative number will have the element move into the different direction of the scroll movement.

Start/Edit workflow

Click this button to create a new workflow triggered by this element. The type of event depends on the element and is generally the most common event. For example, buttons will create a 'When this element is clicked...' event. If a workflow already exists, this takes you to the existing workflow in the Workflow Tab. To create a different type of event or create a second event, go to the Workflow Tab and click the 'Click here to add an event...' button.

This element isn't clickable

When checked, the element will not trigger a workflow when clicked nor will the user's cursor change to a pointer when they hover over the element. In addition, the item will display according to any specified conditional formatting for the 'isn't clickable' state. This can be used to stop a user from moving forward in a flow until some condition is true. For example, we might disable a specific action until the user is logged in. 'This input should not be empty' can also be used to prevent the user from clicking.

Group Focus

[](https://youtu.be/l_SbovrRt2s)

Watch our Academy quick tip on how to set up a Group Focus

A group focus is a group that is automatically hidden when the user clicks outside of it. Position it relative to another element. This is especially useful for dropdown menus.

**Note:** Although the Group Focus container is fixed relative to the page, the iOS keyboard appear event can cause the Group Focus container to move to an unexpected location due to how Apple handles this event.

**Tip:** The same element can be used to open and close a group focus element. Best practice would be to use a "Toggle an element" workflow action on the element to simply open & close the group focus.

**Note:** If you have a searchbox within your Group Focus, clicking one of the searchbox's results will be considered clicking "outside" the Group Focus and therefore close it. A dropdown or custom searchbox are often used in these designs instead.

Reference element

Specify an element to be the location reference for the group.

Offset top

Pushes the group this number of pixels below the reference element.

Offset left

Pushes the group this number of pixels left of the reference element.

Type of content

This allows you to select the type of thing this container displays. Most elements that have this property also have a Data source property, which lets you select the displayed thing or list of things. The value of the data source must match the selected type of content. Let's look at an example of a map with hotels marked. When you click a marker, a popup displays with the name of the hotel. The Type of content would be 'Hotel' and the Data source would be 'Map's current marker.'

Data source

Define the thing or list of things that should be displayed in this container. For example, in groups or popups, only a single thing will display, but for repeating groups a list of things will display. Child elements can access the Data source from their parent. If the parent contains a list of things, the child has access to the individual list items. A common scenario for groups is to display something, like the current user, and then have the group contain the inputs that modify the user's properties, such as text and images that display information about the user. The Type of content determines what kind of thing you are allowed to set in the Data source field. If the type of thing does not match the Data source, it will be marked as an issue, and you must change one or the other to match. The Data source can come from anywhere in Bubble. For example, it could be the result of a search, a custom or built-in Data source, or it could be dynamic and come from the user. The Data source will update when its source changes. For examle, if the search result changes because a user modified some data used in the search constraints, the displayed list will automatically change. For additional flexibility, you can update the Data source in the Conditional Formatting Tab in the Property Editor. Finally, the Data source property can be modified by workflows. Changes made by actions override whatever you specify as the Data source directly or as a conditional state until you run a reset action, which then restores the original setting.

Collapse this element's height when hidden

By default, hiding an element leaves a blank space on the page, exposing whatever is underneath it. When you select this option, however, the elements below the hidden element are pulled upward to fill the space.

Animate the collapse operation

This option is only visible if 'Collapse this element's height when hidden' is selected. By default, elements collapse and expand instantly, but this option animates with either Fade In/Out or Slide Up/Down.

Animation style

This option allows you to choose whether an element's animation will Fade In/Out or Slide Up/Down.

Start/Edit workflow

Click this button to create a new workflow triggered by this element. The type of event depends on the element and is generally the most common event. For example, buttons will create a 'When this element is clicked...' event. If a workflow already exists, this takes you to the existing workflow in the Workflow Tab. To create a different type of event or create a second event, go to the Workflow Tab and click the 'Click here to add an event...' button.

This element isn't clickable

When checked, the element will not trigger a workflow when clicked nor will the user's cursor change to a pointer when they hover over the element. In addition, the item will display according to any specified conditional formatting for the 'isn't clickable' state. This can be used to stop a user from moving forward in a flow until some condition is true. For example, we might disable a specific action until the user is logged in. 'This input should not be empty' can also be used to prevent the user from clicking.

 Container Layout Types

Container layouts define the behavior and positioning of its child elements. Container layout types are available on any container element (group, floating group, repeating group, etc.), including the page itself. Your page must be a responsive container type (ie not “fixed”) to be actually responsive to changes in screen size. Each container layout type has its own set of controls specific to that layout type. In addition, child elements will inherit unique controls depending on the parent container’s selected layout type.

The new container layouts and their controls are outlined below and include sub-sections for Parent container and Child element controls.

**Note:** Parent controls act on the container itself while the Child controls act on the child elements inside the parent container.

**Fixed**

The Fixed layout type defines a fixed width and height container with absolute positioning of its child elements. Child elements are positioned and re-sized by dragging and dropping as you are used to. A container that is fixed will not respond to changes in screen size or content size because what-you-see-is-what-you-get.

Parent Controls

Width & Height

See [Responsive Properties](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/responsive-properties)​

**Align to Parent**

Child elements are aligned to a nonant in the parent container. A nonant is like a quadrant, but when a rectangle is divided into 9 parts instead of 4. New child elements drawn inside or dragged into an Align to Parent will snap to the nearest nonant.

The position and size of child elements are controlled in the property editor, though elements can be re-positioned by dragging and dropping. As the parent container resizes, child elements will remain aligned to their respective nonant and can overlap each other.

​

Pin to nonant selection

Select which nonant this element should be pinned to. The element will stay pinned there as the parent container resizes.

Width & Height

See [Responsive Properties](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/responsive-properties)​

**Row**

Child elements in a row container are aligned horizontally. These child elements will wrap as the screen is resized or new elements are added. New child elements drawn inside the container will be added to the end of the list by default but can be re-ordered using the order controls or by dragging and dropping.

The position and size of child elements are controlled in the property editor.

**Note:** Child elements will grow to take up as much space as they can (within the limits of the max width setting) equally. For example, consider a parent row container that is 100px wide. It has two child elements with min widths of 20px and infinite max widths. These elements will grow to be 50px each. If we add a 3rd equal child element to that row, each element will shrink to 33.33 px wide.

 Containers (Legacy)

Group

Groups are elements that contain other elements. A group has two roles. First, a group gathers elements from a visual perspective, and all the elements in that group move together. It also has a semantic significance. A group can have data injected into it, and the elements inside the group can refer to the Parent group's thing. For example, you can 'display' a user in a group, and all elements inside that group will be able to display the 'Parent group's user's email.' Use this functionality when you want some areas of the app's page to display items relative to a dynamic entry.

[](https://youtu.be/HWmgmzIQRfg)

Our Academy quick tip on how to group elements together

Type of content

This allows you to select the type of thing this container displays. Most elements that have this property also have a Data source property, which lets you select the displayed thing or list of things. The value of the data source must match the selected type of content. Let's look at an example of a map with hotels marked. When you click a marker, a popup displays with the name of the hotel. The Type of content would be 'Hotel' and the Data source would be 'Map's current marker.'

Data source

Define the thing or list of things that should be displayed in this container. For example, in groups or popups, only a single thing will display, but for repeating groups a list of things will display. Child elements can access the Data source from their parent. If the parent contains a list of things, the child has access to the individual list items. A common scenario for groups is to display something, like the current user, and then have the group contain the inputs that modify the user's properties, such as text and images that display information about the user. The Type of content determines what kind of thing you are allowed to set in the Data source field. If the type of thing does not match the Data source, it will be marked as an issue, and you must change one or the other to match. The Data source can come from anywhere in Bubble. For example, it could be the result of a search, a custom or built-in Data source, or it could be dynamic and come from the user. The Data source will update when its source changes. For example, if the search result changes because a user modified some data used in the search constraints, the displayed list will automatically change. For additional flexibility, you can update the Data source in the Conditional Formatting Tab in the Property Editor. Finally, the Data source property can be modified by workflows. Changes made by actions override whatever you specify as the Data source directly or as a conditional state until you run a reset action, which then restores the original setting.

**Note:** As mentioned, Groups can have data assigned to them (e.g. 'this group should show data about user X'). When the data assigned to a group changes, the group will reset all the input fields within itself.

This is useful when the input fields are supposed to change depending on the group's data. But, it can also cause confusion, for example, when a group's data depends on an input that's inside that group!

Collapse this element's height when hidden

By default, hiding an element leaves a blank space on the page, exposing whatever is underneath it. When you select this option, however, the elements below the hidden element are pulled upward to fill the space.

**Tip:** A common pattern for a messaging UI involves a Repeating Group where cells have two Groups (Sender & Receiver) that display the text sent by each respective party. When the message belongs to the Sender, the Receiver group is hidden and vice versa.

Because of a race condition between evaluating conditional visibility of groups in Repeating Group cells and evaluating cell height, blank spaces may appear when switching between the two groups when a new message is sent.

To minimize the risk of this happening, consider enabling "Collapse this element's height when hidden" on both Groups.

**Note:** the "collapse when hidden" property may not always work as expected when used on groups that overlap other groups using the setting.

Animate the collapse operation

This option is only visible if 'Collapse this element's height when hidden' is selected. By default, elements collapse and expand instantly, but this option animates with either Fade In/Out or Slide Up/Down.

Animation style

This option allows you to choose whether an element's animation will Fade In/Out or Slide Up/Down.

**Note:** Animation Style is not currently supported for use on a group in situations where a repeating group's underlying data is changing. In these situations, consider relying on the repeating group's built-in updating instead of adding an animation.

Start/Edit workflow

Click this button to create a new workflow triggered by this element. The type of event depends on the element and is generally the most common event. For example, buttons will create a 'When this element is clicked...' event. If a workflow already exists, this takes you to the existing workflow in the Workflow Tab. To create a different type of event or create a second event, go to the Workflow Tab and click the 'Click here to add an event...' button.

This element isn't clickable

When checked, the element will not trigger a workflow when clicked nor will the user's cursor change to a pointer when they hover over the element. In addition, the item will display according to any specified conditional formatting for the 'isn't clickable' state. This can be used to stop a user from moving forward in a flow until some condition is true. For example, we might disable a specific action until the user is logged in. 'This input should not be empty' can also be used to prevent the user from clicking.

**Tip:** Conditionally changing the borders of a Group will not resize the content in the group, which can lead to undesirable formatting. Consider using two groups (one without a border), and toggling between the two if this behavior is desired.

Repeating Group

Watch this video to learn about using the Repeating Group Element

A repeating group displays lists of things, either coming from the application database or from APIs. Design the first cell, and the remaining cells will follow that design.

Type of content

This allows you to select the type of thing this container displays. Most elements that have this property also have a Data source property, which lets you select the displayed thing or list of things. The value of the data source must match the selected type of content. Let's look at an example of a map with hotels marked. When you click a marker, a popup displays with the name of the hotel. The Type of content would be 'Hotel' and the Data source would be 'Map's current marker.'

Data source

This is the list of things to display in the group. It can either be – The result of a search using 'Do a search for,' – The content of a field whose type is list of things, or – The result of an API call through the 'Get data from an external API.' Once this is set, each cell will display one thing, and the elements drawn inside the cell will be able to refer to the 'Current cell's thing.'

**Note:** Avoid the situation where you automatically change the data source of a repeating group based on a condition that references the repeating group itself! This will cause an infinite loop and the repeating group will not behave as you expect.

Layout style

[](https://youtu.be/abMbztw-lmc)

Watch our Academy quick tip for examples of each of these layouts

This is where to define the general layout of the repeating group. Note that this has a major impact on the performance of your pages, as it impacts how many items get downloaded to draw the repeating group. There are five possible options: – Vertical scrolling: The element adds cells as the user scrolls down, but it doesn't push the elements below it. Instead, users keep scrolling. This is efficient as it only loads visible items from the server to display the cells. – Extendable vertical scrolling: The element adds cells as the user scrolls down, and it pushes the elements below down. This is like Facebook's feed and is also efficient for the same reason as above. – Full list: The element draws as many cells as there are items in the data source. This is not the best approach when the list is long, as it loads many items, including some that aren't visible at first. This is not recommended for long lists. – Fixed number of cells: Only shows a fixed number of entries. Use the show next/previous actions to navigate in the workflows. The performance depends on your design, with a low number of cells this is efficient, with many cells it can slow down your pages. – Horizontal scrolling: The element add cells as the user scrolls right. In this mode, the repeating group can only have one row. Given the width of screens, this is usually safe performance-wise. The cells are still expandable if the content inside them is 'Set to stretch to fit content.'

**Tip:** The different types of repeating groups behave differently when there is too *little* content to fill even the drawn number of cells:

- Vertical scrolling, ext vertical scrolling and fixed number of cells will show, at minimum, the number of cells drawn in the editor, even if there is no content to fill those cells
- A full list repeating group will shrink in height if there's not enough content to fill its cells, potentially even collapsing completely if there is no content

Rows

Enter the number of rows to display in this repeating group. This setting only applies when the layout is set to 'Fixed number of cells.'

Columns

Enter the number of columns to display in this repeating group. Entering 1 will make the element like a list, while a larger number will give a tile aspect to the repeating group.

Cell minimum width for responsive (px)

When the page is responsive, specify the smallest width the cells can have when the page is resized. When the page becomes too narrow for all the cells to have that width, the repeating group displays fewer cells per row.

Show partial list on last page if needed

When the repeating group is set to Fixed number of cells, this controls whether an incomplete last page should be filled with items from the previous page. E.G: If there are 6 items in a 4x1 repeating group, then with this option off, the last page will contain the last four items, items 3 through 6, so items 3 and 4 will be duplicated on both pages; with this option on, the last page will only contain the remaining items, items 5 and 6.

Allow more than one column when stretched

By default, if a repeating group only has one column, e.g., Excel sheet style, no more columns are added when the page is stretched. To change this behavior, check this box.

Separator Style

Select the type of border to display between the cells. Choose from None or a stylized line, such as Solid, Dashed, and Double.

Separator Width

Enter the width to apply to the separator in pixels. Set a width even with a separator of None. In this case, the cells will have some empty space between them.

Separator Color

Select the separator color.

Start/Edit workflow

Click this button to create a new workflow triggered by this element. The type of event depends on the element and is generally the most common event. For example, buttons will create a 'When this element is clicked...' event. If a workflow already exists, this takes you to the existing workflow in the Workflow Tab. To create a different type of event or create a second event, go to the Workflow Tab and click the 'Click here to add an event...' button.

This element isn't clickable

When checked, the element will not trigger a workflow when clicked nor will the user's cursor change to a pointer when they hover over the element. In addition, the item will display according to any specified conditional formatting for the 'isn't clickable' state. This can be used to stop a user from moving forward in a flow until some condition is true. For example, we might disable a specific action until the user is logged in. 'This input should not be empty' can also be used to prevent the user from clicking.

Popup

Popups are hidden from the user until you display them from the Workflow Tab. When they are visible, they are fixed position in the center of the viewport. If the popup is longer than the viewport, the user will be able to scroll to see the full content. If the popup is shorter than the viewport, the user will not be able to scroll.

[](https://youtu.be/YXxYeHlowWk)

Our Academy quick tip on how to use popups

**Tip:** If the popup is longer than the viewport, scrolling will be enabled, and scroll distance is tied to the length of the page in the background. If you have a very long page, the user will be able to continue scrolling the entire length of the background page, potentially past the point where the popup is no longer visible.

Type of content

This allows you to select the type of thing this container displays. Most elements that have this property also have a Data source property, which lets you select the displayed thing or list of things. The value of the data source must match the selected type of content. Let's look at an example of a map with hotels marked. When you click a marker, a popup displays with the name of the hotel. The Type of content would be 'Hotel' and the Data source would be 'Map's current marker.'

Data source

Define the thing or list of things that should be displayed in this container. For example, in groups or popups, only a single thing will display, but for repeating groups a list of things will display. Child elements can access the Data source from their parent. If the parent contains a list of things, the child has access to the individual list items. A common scenario for groups is to display something, like the current user, and then have the group contain the inputs that modify the user's properties, such as text and images that display information about the user. The Type of content determines what kind of thing you are allowed to set in the Data source field.

For example, if the search result changes because a user modified some data used in the search constraints, the displayed list will automatically change. For additional flexibility, you can update the Data source in the Conditional Formatting Tab in the Property Editor. Finally, the Data source property can be modified by workflows. Changes made by actions override whatever you specify as the Data source directly or as a conditional state until you run a reset action, which then restores the original setting.

This popup can't be closed by pressing 'Esc'

By default, popups can be closed by the user when pressing Esc. To disable this behavior and make the popup modal, check this box. In this case, the only way to close the popup is with a Hide Popup action in a workflow.

Grayout color

Select the color of the background when a popup is open. By default, it is set to a dark transparent layer.

Grayout blur

Enter a number greater than 0 to set a blur effect on the background. While this offers an interesting design, the display speed of the popup may be affected.

Start/Edit workflow

Click this button to create a new workflow triggered by this element. The type of event depends on the element and is generally the most common event. For example, buttons will create a 'When this element is clicked...' event. If a workflow already exists, this takes you to the existing workflow in the Workflow Tab.

'This input should not be empty' can also be used to prevent the user from clicking.

Floating Group

[](https://youtu.be/lvuovDbPsHg)

Watch our Academy quick tip on how to set up a floating group

Floating groups are groups that float on the screen on top of the page but are not contained within the page. These are useful to keep an element in the same place on the screen regardless of the scrolling position of the page or the visibility of groups within the page. Floating groups are useful for headers, buttons like 'Scroll to top,' etc.

Type of content

This allows you to select the type of thing this container displays. Most elements that have this property also have a Data source property, which lets you select the displayed thing or list of things. The value of the data source must match the selected type of content. Let's look at an example of a map with hotels marked. When you click a marker, a popup displays with the name of the hotel. The Type of content would be 'Hotel' and the Data source would be 'Map's current marker.'

Changes made by actions override whatever you specify as the Data source directly or as a conditional state until you run a reset action, which then restores the original setting.

Vertically float relative to

Using this dropdown menu, choose the base to calculate the position of the floating group. Choose from: – Top: The distance between the top edge of the group and the top of the user's screen remains constant, no matter the scrolling position of the page. This is the default. – Bottom: The distance between the bottom of the group and the user's screen remains constant no matter the scrolling position of the page. – Both: Both the top and bottom distances will remain constant, and a scrollbar will appear if the group is too short to show all its content. – Nothing: The floating group will not float, meaning that it behaves like a regular group. For example, the distance is calculated as the height between the top edge of the floating group and the top of the Bubble page. Then, it displays the floating group that distance from the top of the user's screen. Note: By placing the floating group high on the page and making it float relative to the bottom, the element may be 'above' the top of the screen and not display.

Horizontally float relative to

Use this dropdown menu to determine whether the element floats relative to the Right or Left. Right and Left refer to the horizontal edges of the page. This option is less common than vertical reference, but it is useful when you want an element to display no matter the page width.

Floating zindex

Floating groups can be above other elements or beneath the page, and then be used as a background design option. Note that when a floating element is beneath elements, it will only visible if the page background is transparent

Parallax effect factor

When a floating group is beneath the page, you can apply a parallax effect to give some depth to the page. A factor of 1 will remove any parallax effect, while a factor of 0 will keep the element fixed, and a factor of 2 will make the element move twice faster than the scrolling position. A negative number will have the element move into the different direction of the scroll movement.

Start/Edit workflow

Click this button to create a new workflow triggered by this element. The type of event depends on the element and is generally the most common event. For example, buttons will create a 'When this element is clicked...' event. If a workflow already exists, this takes you to the existing workflow in the Workflow Tab. To create a different type of event or create a second event, go to the Workflow Tab and click the 'Click here to add an event...' button.

This element isn't clickable

In addition, the item will display according to any specified conditional formatting for the 'isn't clickable' state. This can be used to stop a user from moving forward in a flow until some condition is true. For example, we might disable a specific action until the user is logged in. 'This input should not be empty' can also be used to prevent the user from clicking.

Group Focus

[](https://youtu.be/l_SbovrRt2s)

Watch our Academy quick tip on how to set up a Group Focus

A group focus is a group that is automatically hidden when the user clicks outside of it. Position it relative to another element. This is especially useful for dropdown menus.

**Note:** Although the Group Focus container is fixed relative to the page, the iOS keyboard appear event can cause the Group Focus container to move to an unexpected location due to how Apple handles this event.

**Tip:** The same element can now be used to open and close a group focus element. Best practice would be to use a “Toggle an element” workflow action on the element to simply open & close the group focus.

**Note: I**f you have a searchbox within your Group Focus, clicking one of the searchbox's results will be considered clicking "outside" the Group Focus and therefore close it. A dropdown or custom searchbox are often used in these designs instead.

Reference element

Specify an element to be the location reference for the group.

Offset top

Pushes the group this number of pixels below the reference element.

Offset left

Pushes the group this number of pixels left of the reference element.

Type of content

This allows you to select the type of thing this container displays. Most elements that have this property also have a Data source property, which lets you select the displayed thing or list of things. The value of the data source must match the selected type of content. Let's look at an example of a map with hotels marked. When you click a marker, a popup displays with the name of the hotel. The Type of content would be 'Hotel' and the Data source would be 'Map's current marker.'

Data source

Define the thing or list of things that should be displayed in this container. For example, in groups or popups, only a single thing will display, but for repeating groups a list of things will display. Child elements can access the Data source from their parent. If the parent contains a list of things, the child has access to the individual list items. A common scenario for groups is to display something, like the current user, and then have the group contain the inputs that modify the user's properties, such as text and images that display information about the user. The Type of content determines what kind of thing you are allowed to set in the Data source field. If the type of thing does not match the Data source, it will be marked as an issue, and you must change one or the other to match. The Data source can come from anywhere in Bubble. For example, it could be the result of a search, a custom or built-in Data source, or it could be dynamic and come from the user. The Data source will update when its source changes. For examle, if the search result changes because a user modified some data used in the search constraints, the displayed list will automatically change. For additional flexibility, you can update the Data source in the Conditional Formatting Tab in the Property Editor. Finally, the Data source property can be modified by workflows. Changes made by actions override whatever you specify as the Data source directly or as a conditional state until you run a reset action, which then restores the original setting.

Collapse this element's height when hidden

By default, hiding an element leaves a blank space on the page, exposing whatever is underneath it. When you select this option, however, the elements below the hidden element are pulled upward to fill the space.

Animate the collapse operation

This option is only visible if 'Collapse this element's height when hidden' is selected. By default, elements collapse and expand instantly, but this option animates with either Fade In/Out or Slide Up/Down.

Animation style

This option allows you to choose whether an element's animation will Fade In/Out or Slide Up/Down.

Start/Edit workflow

Click this button to create a new workflow triggered by this element. The type of event depends on the element and is generally the most common event. For example, buttons will create a 'When this element is clicked...' event. If a workflow already exists, this takes you to the existing workflow in the Workflow Tab. To create a different type of event or create a second event, go to the Workflow Tab and click the 'Click here to add an event...' button.

This element isn't clickable

When checked, the element will not trigger a workflow when clicked nor will the user's cursor change to a pointer when they hover over the element. In addition, the item will display according to any specified conditional formatting for the 'isn't clickable' state. This can be used to stop a user from moving forward in a flow until some condition is true. For example, we might disable a specific action until the user is logged in. 'This input should not be empty' can also be used to prevent the user from clicking.

Check this box if the input should not be empty when a workflow using its content is run. In other words, Bubble prevents workflows from running until these inputs are filled. Use this to make sure all necessary information has been entered by the user before a workflow is run. When an input is empty and shouldn't be, it is marked as invalid by Bubble.

This input is disabled

Check this box to prevent users from interacting with the input element. In this case, the content of the input will be accessible on a read-only basis.

Input

Watch this video to learn more about the Input Element

This element enables users to type text on one line. It's useful for typing in an email or password.

**Note:** The 'undo' ctrl+z command has been disabled for Inputs due to a bug in the library we use for input formatting.

Placeholder

When this element is empty, text will be displayed to prompt the user to enter something.

Initial content

This field defines the input before the user modifies it or when reset. For example, when a user modifies their email, the initial content will likely be 'Current user's email.'

Content format

Select a type from this dropdown menu to define the input type. This is important for two reasons: – To make sure that what is entered is valid and prevents workflows from running if the content isn't valid. In this case, the input is set to an 'Isn't valid state.' This detects, for instance, when an email address follows the pattern 'name@example.com.' – It sometimes controls what characters can be typed and what characters are added automatically, in order to visually assist users for dates, passwords, etc. Choose from: – Text: A plain sequence of characters or numbers. – Email: An email address. – Password: A sequence of characters that are hidden as the user types. – Integer: A number without decimals. – Decimal: A number with decimals. – Address: A geographic address. With this option, the input automatically validates the address with Google Maps. – US Phone: A phone number following the format (xxx) yyy-zzzz. – Percentage: A number represented as 12.35% equaling 0.1235. – Currency: A number with a currency symbol as a prefix. – Date: A date following the format mm/dd/yyyy. – Euro date: A date following the European standard dd.mm.yyyy. – Text (numbers only): A sequence of numbers, like a reference number, that isn't interpreted as a numerical quantity.

**Tip:** Because of the predictive text functionality on Android devices, some content formats involving masks have a slightly different UX. This is for: US Phone, Percentage, Currency, Date, Euro date, and Text (numbers only). On these devices, the input allows users to type anything and validates the content against the mask only after the user stops typing. The end result is the same.

Currency Symbol

When the type of content is Currency, choose the currency symbol to use as a prefix from this dropdown menu. If a prefix is missing you can type your own in the box.

Always show decimals

With Currency selected, check this box to always show two decimal places.

Show thousands separator

For integer or decimal inputs, automatically inserts the thousands separator as the user types

Decimal place

Set this to always show a specific number of digits after the decimal point. Extra digits will be filled with 0. Any value will be rounded to the appropriate decimal place before displaying in the input. Leave blank to have no rounding, and no restriction on the number of digits.

Limit the number of characters

Check this box to prevent users from entering long entries.

Time zone selection

Overriding timezones in the backend requires that you activate the advanced setting *Enable timezone override controls* in your app's general settings.

Reference: [Application settings: Advanced](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/application-settings/generaadvanced-options)​

When the type of content is Date or Euro date, select a type from this dropdown menu to define the timezone type with which you are parsing data. The default timezone with which data is parsed will be the client timezone ("User's current timezone"). However, you can override this option by setting an alternative timezone with a static or dynamic choice.

Both Date and Euro date will be by default parsed as the date at midnight for the client timezone. If you specify a timezone different from the client timezone, then the date will be parsed as that date at midnight in the overriding timezone. As an example, if you parse 1/1/2000 from Eastern Time and keep the default setting, Bubble will save that date as 1/1/2000 12:00 AM Eastern Time. If you instead override the client timezone with Pacific Time, selecting 1/1/2000 will save 1/1/2000 12:00 AM Pacific Time.

Prevent "enter" key from submitting

Normally, when users click ENTER, workflows associated with the input get triggered/submitted. If you check this box, that will not happen.

Maximum number

Enter the maximum number of characters allowed.

Set a range (min and max)

Check this box to restrict the numerical values users can enter.

Minimum Value

Set the minimum value users can enter. Make this value dynamic by using the Composer.

Maximum Value

Set the maximum value users can enter. Make this value dynamic by using the Composer.

Check the password while typing

If a password policy is defined in the General section in the Settings Tab, check this box to validate the input against that policy. Advanced: This is useful if you only want to make that check on the server.

Multiline Input

Watch this video to learn more about the Mulitline Input element

Multiline inputs allow users to enter text on several lines.

Placeholder

When this element is empty, text will be displayed to prompt the user to enter something.

Initial content

This field defines the input before the user modifies it or when reset. For example, when users modify their bio, the initial content will likely be 'Current user's bio.'

Limit the number of characters

Check this box to prevent users from entering long entries.

Maximum number

Enter the maximum number of characters allowed.

Stretch to fit content

Check this box to resize the element when the text becomes too long to fit the container.

Checkbox

Watch this video to learn more about the Checkbox Element

Displays a labeled checkbox.

Label

Enter the text to display next to the checkbox. Clicking on the text is equivalent to clicking the checkbox itself.

Preset status

Define the initial value of the checkbox. Choose from Checked, Unchecked, and Dynamic.

Dynamic status

This option is only visible if Preset status is set to Dynamic. Specifying a dynamic yes/no value determines whether this element starts in an on or off state. When the dynamic value changes, e.g., the user modifies data that the dynamic status field references, the checkbox will change to reflect the new value. This continues until the user clicks on the element and changes the state, in which case the state will be determined by their selection rather than by a dynamic value.

This checkbox should be checked

When checked, workflows using the content of the checkbox won't run until the content of the box is checked. This is useful, for instance, to force users to accept Terms of Services (ToS) when they sign up.

Dropdown

Watch this video to learn more about the Dropdown element

Dropdowns display a list of a choices to the user through a familiar interface. The choices can either come from the database or be entered in the Bubble Editor as a list of texts.

Placeholder

When this element is empty, text will be displayed to prompt the user to enter something.

Choices style

A dropdown element either prompts the user to choose one option from static choices or dynamic data from the application database. In this dropdown menu, choose between Static choices or Dynamic choices.

Choices (press Enter between each option)

This is the list of static choices offered to users. Enter one option per line and press Enter between each option.

Type of choices

This is the type of thing used by the element when Dynamic choices is chosen in the Choices style.

Choices source

Define the list of things to be used as options. It should be a list of things of type defined as the 'Type of choices.' It is either the result of a search or the content of a field that is a list.

Option caption

Define how to display the thing in the dropdown menu. For example, to display users, build an expression like 'Current option's first name Current option's last name' as a caption.

Default value

This is the default value displayed in the dropdown menu. It should be of the same type as the type of content defined in 'Type of choices.'

**Tip:** When using the native dropdown element in Bubble, Bubble will use the browser's native dropdown HTML component. This often has very limited styling options and varies from browser to browser. For example, text alignment may not work across all browsers, because not all browsers support that feature for their native dropdowns. To create a more custom dropdown, consider building one using a [Group Focus](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/containergroup-focus) element.

**Note:** due to how Firefox treats dropdowns, dropdown placeholder text cannot be changed conditionally on Firefox.

Search Box

Watch this video to learn more about the Searchbox element

This element searches for dynamic options with an autocomplete experience. The users start typing a word or address, and the dropdown menu displays matching options in real time.

Placeholder

When this element is empty, text will be displayed to prompt the user to enter something.

Choices style

A search box either displays a static list of texts like a list of countries, dynamic data from the application database, or displays addresses using the Google Autocomplete API. Choose from Static choices, Dynamic choices, and Geographic places.

Choices (press Enter between each option)

This is the list of static choices offered to users. Enter one option per line and press Enter between each option.

Define list of options

Clicking this button displays a search popup. The search dropdown contains a dynamic list of entries users can search from. Add constraints to restrict the list.

Define list of options

If you set up algolia, you will see a popup like the regular search, in which you can choose the type indexed in Algolia you want to search for.

Field to search

When choosing a dynamic source of entries, define which field will contain the texts to use for autocompletion. Set this in the 'Field to search' property. For example, to display restaurants in the search box, set the list of options as a 'Search for restaurants' and choose 'Name' as the field to search.

Field to display

If you choose to search across all the indexed fields, you may choose to display a particular one, or the one that matched your search.

Allow entries not in list

Check this box to allow the user to type something that is not in the dynamic list. Access the typed text as 'Input's typed text.'

Maximum entries to show

Change the maximum number of entries to show in the dropdown. Longer lists take more time to load.

Prevent "enter" key from submitting

Normally, when users click ENTER, workflows associated with the input get triggered/submitted. If you check this box, that will not happen.

Default value

This is the default value to use in the search box. It should be of the same type as the 'Type of choices.'

Prefer results around

The point around which you wish to retrieve place information. This is optional.

Radius (meters)

The distance (in meters) within which to prefer place results.

Radio Buttons

Watch this video to learn more about Radio Buttons Element

This element displays a list of buttons where users can choose only one option. The options come either from a list of static choices or dynamic list.

Choices style

A radio button element can either prompt the user to pick from a list of static choices like states or display dynamic data from the application database. Choose from Static choices and Dynamic choices from this dropdown menu.

Choices (press Enter between each option)

This is the list of static choices offered to users. Enter one option per line and press Enter between each option.

Type of choices

This is the type of thing used by the radio button element.

Choices source

Define the list of things to be used as options. It should be a list of things of type defined as the 'Type of choices.' It is either the result of a search or content of a field that is a list.

Option caption

Define how to display the thing in the list of radio buttons. For example, to display users, build an expression like 'Current option's first name' as a caption.

Default value

This is the default value to determine the selected radio button. It should be of the same type as the 'Type of choices.'

Number of columns

Enter the number of columns for the buttons. The width of the caption will be adjusted automatically to fit the number of columns given the total element width.

Bootstrap color

Choose the color for the actual radio buttons. Choose from the Twitter Bootstrap library of colors: Black, Primary, Danger, Info, Warning, and Success.

Slider Input

[](https://youtu.be/4GxuhmKij_4)

Watch our Academy quick tip on how to use this input

This element allows users to select a value from a numeric range by dragging a slider. It is touch-compatible, so it works on mobile devices.

Min Value

Enter the minimum value for the slider.

Max Value

Enter the maximum value for the slider.

Step

This number represents how much one increment should modify the slider's value.

Slider type

A Simple slider will have one handle and return one number. A Range slider will have two handles and return two numbers. The handle is what the user moves to change the slider value. This setting will appear in the Property Editor when no style is attached. When a style is attached, this setting will instead be adjusted in the Styles tab.

**Note:** The second handle for the Range slider will only appear in Live mode.

Initial content

Define the initial value of the slider. If the content is dynamic, it should be of type number.

Orientation

This property defines whether the slider is Horizontal or Vertical.

Border color

Choose the color of the borders of the slider and handle. The handle is what the user moves to change the slider value.

Background color

Choose the color of the slider background.

Handle color

Choose the color of the handle. The handle is what the user moves to change the slider value.

Range area color

When using Range mode, this property defines the color between the two handles. The handle is what the user moves to change the slider value.

**Note:** The second handle for the Range slider will only appear in Live mode.

Date/Time Picker

Watch this video to learn more about the Date/Time Picker Element

This element allows users to choose a date and optionally a time with a calendar-type interface. The value returned by this element is a date that can be used in date fields.

Time zone selection

Select a type from this dropdown menu to define the timezone type with which you are parsing data. The default timezone with which data is parsed will be the client timezone ("User's current timezone"). However, you can override this option by setting an alternative timezone with a static or dynamic choice.

For instance, if you (the client) are in Eastern Time, you can override the timezone by statically or dynamically specifying a new timezone such as Pacific Time. Then, when you enter 1/1/2000 9:00 AM, it will be parsed as 1/1/2000 9:00 AM Pacific Time, rather than 1/1/2000 9:00 AM Eastern Time.

If you are parsing a date (with no time specified), it will be by default parsed as the date at midnight for the client timezone. If you specify a timezone different from the client timezone, then the date will be parsed as that date at midnight in the overriding timezone. As an example, if you parse 1/1/2000 from Eastern Time and keep the default setting, Bubble will save that date as 1/1/2000 12:00 AM Eastern Time. If you instead override the client timezone with Pacific Time, selecting 1/1/2000 will save 1/1/2000 12:00 AM Pacific Time.

Input type

Choose from Date and Date & Time to determine if a time will be used in addition to the date.

Initial content

Define the initial value of the date. It should be of type date and will be red until the entry has the correct type.

**Tip:** If you select date-only for your Date-Time picker, choose an initial content that does not include a time. If you use Current date/time instead, filters based on this initial content may filter out new data where date is still Current Date but after Current Time.

Customize the input placeholder

By default, the date/time picker shows a placeholder with a date and format selected. To customize it, check this box. Note: This option is only available in Date mode.

Placeholder

Enter the placeholder to use for the date.

Date format

From this dropdown menu, choose how to format the date.

Custom format

If you need to use a custom format for the date, you can define it here.

Start the week on Monday

Check this box to start the week on Monday, which is the European style. By default, the week starts on Sunday.

Display dropdowns to pick month/year

Check this box to allow users to change the month and year quickly. This is useful for dates in the past, like birthdays.

Time interval

This property defines how many minutes should exist between two options. Note: This option is only available in Date mode.

Time format

From this dropdown menu, choose how to format the time.

Minimum date

Use this field to prevent users from choosing a day before a certain date/time. This field can be dynamic, in which case the expression defined should be of type date (which includes time).

Maximum date

Use this field to prevent users from choosing a day after a certain datetime. This field can be dynamic, in which case the expression defined should be of type date (which includes time).

Minimum hour

Use this field to prevent users from choosing a time before a certain hour of the day. This field can be dynamic, in which case the expression defined should be of type number. It must be in 24h format, i.e., 17:26 for 5:26 PM.

Maximum hour

Use this field to prevent users from choosing a time after a certain hour of the day. This field can be dynamic, in which case the expression defined should be of type number. It must be in 24h format, i.e., 17:26 for 5:26 PM.

Picture Uploader

[](https://youtu.be/ZXjhQkM5qV0)

Our Academy quick tip on how to set up the picture uploader

This element allows users to upload an image. When they click the button, they're prompted to choose an image to upload. On mobile devices, the option to take a picture with the phone's camera is also offered. Once the image is uploaded, the button displays the image.

Placeholder

When this element is empty, text will be displayed to prompt the user to enter something.

Default

This field defines the initial content of the picture uploader. It can either be an uploaded static image or dynamic information from the application database, such as 'Current user's picture.'

Make this file private

By default, uploaded files are visible to anyone who has the link to the file. To provide an additional layer of security to files uploaded through this element, select this option. You will be prompted to select a thing to permanently attach the file to. That item can then be used to restrict access to the file via privacy rules.

Note: when uploading to Box, set privacy rules in the Data > Privacy tab.

Attach this file to

This option is only visible if 'Make this file private' is selected. Private files uploaded with this element are permanently attached to a thing, which is used to determine who has access to view the file. Only users who have the 'View attached files' permission for that thing can view the file. Go to the Privacy section to create privacy rules that grant this permission. If the value of 'Attach this file to' is empty or the thing does not exist, the file will be visible to anyone who has the link, which is the same as if 'Make this file private' was not selected.

Storage service

By default, uploaded files are stored by Bubble using Amazon's S3 file hosting service. You can optionally select a third-party storage service instead by adding that service as a plugin. Currently we support one third-party service, Box.

Note: when uploading to Box, set privacy rules in the Data > Privacy tab.

Folder path

Enter the destination in your Box to upload the file. The destination is a forward-slash (/) separated list of folder names, such as 'My Folder/My Subfolder.' Bubble will automatically create folders if they do not already exist, and dynamic data can be used to build the folder path.

Limit image size before upload

By default, an image uploads without resizing. If the image is large, this may lead to a slower upload. If an image is larger than 800 x 600 pixels, check this box to resize the image to these dimensions.

File Uploader

Watch this video to learn more about the File Uploader Element

This element allows users to upload a file. When they click the button, they're prompted to choose a file to upload. Once the file is uploaded, the button displays the file name.

Placeholder

When this element is empty, text will be displayed to prompt the user to enter something.

Default

This field defines the initial content of the file uploader. It can either be an uploaded static image or dynamic information from the application database, such as 'Current user's resume.'

Make this file private

By default, uploaded files are visible to anyone who has the link to the file. To provide an additional layer of security to files uploaded through this element, select this option. You will be prompted to select a thing to permanently attach the file to. That item can then be used to restrict access to the file via privacy rules.

Note: when uploading to Box, set privacy rules in the Data > Privacy tab.

Attach this file to

This option is only visible if 'Make this file private' is selected. Private files uploaded with this element are permanently attached to a thing, which is used to determine who has access to view the file. Only users who have the 'View attached files' permission for that thing can view the file. Go to the Privacy section to create privacy rules that grant this permission. If the value of 'Attach this file to' is empty or the thing does not exist, the file will be visible to anyone who has the link, which is the same as if 'Make this file private' was not selected.

By default, uploaded files are stored by Bubble using Amazon's S3 file hosting service. You can optionally select a third-party storage service instead by adding that service as a plugin. Currently we support one third-party service, Box.

Note: when uploading to Box, set privacy rules in the Data > Privacy tab.

Folder path

Enter the destination in your Box to upload the file. The destination is a forward-slash (/) separated list of folder names, such as 'My Folder/My Subfolder.' Bubble will automatically create folders if they do not already exist, and dynamic data can be used to build the folder path.

Max file size (MB)

Use this field to limit the size of files uploaded from this element. The value will be the maximum number of megabytes. Default is 50 MB. Files as large as 5 GB can be uploaded to Bubble (see comment below), while the Box limit is 50 MB.

While Bubble officially supports file uploads of up to **5 GB**, most major browser don't support reliably uploading bigger files than **2 GB**. To be safe, you may want to see this as the practical limit.

​
 Reusable Elements

A reusable element creates an element that contains other elements, like a group, that can be used in more than one place. This is useful when reusing the same elements often. Using reusable elements keeps the app smaller and makes it easier to edit.

**Note:** Be careful when nesting reusable elements, especially many layers deep, as this can slow down page load performance significantly.

Type of element

A reusable element can be a Group, Popup, or Floating Group. In the case of a popup, the reusable element will be behave like a popup, i.e., modal and have a grayout until it is shown.

Type of content

This allows you to select the type of thing this container displays. Most elements that have this property also have a Data source property, which lets you select the displayed thing or list of things. The value of the data source must match the selected type of content. Let's look at an example of a map with hotels marked. When you click a marker, a popup displays with the name of the hotel. The Type of content would be 'Hotel' and the Data source would be 'Map's current marker.'

Data source

Define the thing or list of things that should be displayed in this container. For example, in groups or popups, only a single thing will display, but for repeating groups a list of things will display. Child elements can access the Data source from their parent. If the parent contains a list of things, the child has access to the individual list items. A common scenario for groups is to display something, like the current user, and then have the group contain the inputs that modify the user's properties, such as text and images that display information about the user. The Type of content determines what kind of thing you are allowed to set in the Data source field. If the type of thing does not match the Data source, it will be marked as an issue, and you must change one or the other to match. The Data source can come from anywhere in Bubble. For example, it could be the result of a search, a custom or built-in Data source, or it could be dynamic and come from the user. The Data source will update when its source changes. For example, if the search result changes because a user modified some data used in the search constraints, the displayed list will automatically change. For additional flexibility, you can update the Data source in the Conditional Formatting Tab in the Property Editor.

**Note:** While the "auto updating" behavior of a Reusable Element's dynamic data source is generally desirable, there are certain scenarios where this may cause unexpected behavior. For example, consider the following scenario:

Your page has a Repeating Group to display a List of Things, where each cell contains a Reusable Element. The Repeating Group's List of Things is sorted by some field on the Data Type and inside the Reusable Element is an auto-binding popup form that changes that Thing's sorting field. When the popup is open, and the order of the List of Things is changed, the popup will lose its reference to the Thing from the original cell and instead reference the new cell in its place.

To workaround this limitation, consider making the popup form non auto-binding. Or, create a static reference to the Thing in the Reusable element by setting a custom state equal to the Reusable Element's thing when opening the popup form and having the popup reference the custom state.

Finally, the Data source property can be modified by workflows. Changes made by actions override whatever you specify as the Data source directly or as a conditional state until you run a reset action, which then restores the original setting.

Delete this reusable element

Delete the reusable element. Pages using this element will display a 'Deleted reusable element' placeholder.

Reusable element properties

You can add additional properties to a reusable element that can then be used to pass data to and from that element:

- **Dynamic value**: any basic data type or custom data type​
- **Color picker:** a hex color code or a saved color variable.
- **Checkbox:** a yes/no value to or from the reusable.

 Element Templates (legacy)

​

This page describes a deprecated feature and is no longer updated.

Element templates have been replaced by the Component Library. You can read more about this feature in the article below.

Article: [The Component Library](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/design/the-component-library)​

Bubble includes 2 element templates for you to add common functionality to your application.

Tab Element

This template includes a "Group Tab" that adds 3 tabs to your application. When a button such as "Tab 1" is clicked, a custom state is set to 1. The content for the tabs will either be visible or invisible based on when the custom state's number matches its tab number. This is useful for creating a page-like effect without leaving the initial page.

Signup / Login Form

This form includes an input for the user's email, password, and password confirmation so they can create an account with your application. If a user chooses to switch to login mode instead, they can enter their existing credentials and reset their password if needed.

 Workflows

This is the short-form technical core reference entry for workflows. If you are unfamiliar with how workflows work we recommend exploring the article series below to learn more:

User manual article series: [Workflows](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/workflows)​

Bubble operates on a workflow-centric programming model. Workflows dictate the app's response to user interactions.

Each workflow consists of a triggering event and a subsequent sequence of actions. For instance, a workflow might be set up such that when the *Signup* button is clicked, it registers the user, dispatches an email, and then navigates to a different page.

Workflows are tied to individual pages within the app and can be managed under the *Workflow Tab*. If an action produces output, it can be referenced as 'Result of previous step.'

The following section details all the events and actions available within Bubble.

Condition

There may be times when a workflow or action should only execute under certain conditions. This might be when a user is logged in, a checkbox is selected, or if the user's email belongs to a specific domain.

To cater to these scenarios, you can attach a condition to the event. Conditions consist of dynamic expressions that return a *yes* or *no*. For actions, if the condition is not satisfied, that specific action will be bypassed, but subsequent actions will continue, albeit without data from the skipped action.

**Note:** When creating a workflow involving Rich Text, be careful when also using the "Text/Button ... is pressed" conditional statement on the same Rich Text - the two can interfere. As a workaround, consider adding a transparent shape on top and making that the source of the on click workflows.

Element

Choose the element that the event/action applies to.

Workflow folder

Assign a workflow/event to a folder for clarity in the app. Create a new folder by selecting the 'Create a new folder…' entry at the bottom of this dropdown menu or from the Workflow folders section in the Palette.

**Tip:** To display the workflow folders, from the Workflow Tab, click the arrow in the long vertical area to the right of the Tab section in the Palette.

Event color

Select a color for the event. This organizes workflows when the app becomes more complex. This color only appears in Development mode.

Add a breakpoint in debug mode

When using the debugger, instead of using the step-by-step mode for all workflows, specify specific events or actions that should pause. Checking this box allows this. This option has no effect on the app when the debugger isn't present. Similarly, when users are using the app, this will not be applied.

Disable workflow

Occasionally, when debugging, you may want to disable a workflow without getting rid of it. This could allow you to test specific pieces of functionality without consequent workflows getting in the way, or to modify an existing workflow while keeping a copy of the version that is already working for future reference.

 Events

Events trigger workflows.

Events are classified into three categories:

- **General**: Such as 'User is logged in' or 'Do when condition is true'
- **Elements**: Such as 'An element is clicked' or 'An input's value is changed'
- **Custom**: Create a custom, reusable event

This section covers all of the events in Bubble's core library and their respective parameters.

 General Events

User is logged in

Watch this video to learn more about the User is Logged In Event

This event is triggered when the current user logs in. This can happen on page load, if the user was already logged in, or when the user successfully completes a 'Sign the user up' action.

User is logged out

Watch this video to learn more about the User is Logged Out Event

This event is triggered when the current user logs out. This can happen on page load, if the user was logged out, or when the user successfully completes a 'Log the user out' action. Often a change page action occurs after this event.

Page is loaded

[](https://youtu.be/Dm8Kp0micic)

Our Academy quick tip on how to create an event on page load

This event is triggered when the page is loaded. Use this to check the type of user for instance. By adding a condition to an event, the user can be redirected to another page under certain circumstances. A typical case would be 'When the page is loaded' and 'Current user isn't logged in,' go to page 'index.'

Do every X seconds

Watch this video to learn more about the Do Every X Seconds Event

This event performs an action every X seconds. Bubble updates in real time, so this event will not be used often.

Interval

Enter a number in seconds to define the interval.

Note that running an operation at frequent intervals can quickly have a negative effect on your app's performance. It's best to use this feature with caution so that you don't overload the server or user's device. Be mindful of what kind of actions you are running, and don't repeat them more frequently than you need to.

Do when condition is true

Watch this video to learn more about the Do When Condition Is True Event

This event is triggered as soon as its condition is true. If 'Run this' is set to 'Just once,' it will run once per page load, either immediately if the condition is true when the page loads or later when it becomes true. If 'Run this' is set to 'Every time,' the workflow is triggered every time the condition is true.

Note that the *Do When Condition is True* event can lead to performance issues if it is triggered too frequently. It's best to use this feature with caution so that you don't overload the server or user's device. Be mindful of what kind condition you are placing on the event and what kind of actions are executed when the condition is true to maintain a stable level of capacity usage.

Run this

Choose from 'Just once' and 'Every time' to specify whether the event will run once per page load or every time the condition becomes true.

An unhandled error occurs

Watch this video to learn more about the Unhandled Error Occurs Event

This event is triggered if the user interacts with an element, like clicking a button, and there is an error handling for that interaction. This event is only triggered if no 'An element has an error running a workflow' event specific to the element runs. This will execute if the error happens anywhere on the page and happens for both expected errors, such as a failed login attempt, and unexpected errors, such as a bug with the Bubble platform. If no error workflows are defined, the default is to display an alert with an error message. If at least one error workflow runs successfully, i.e., the condition passes and the workflow runs without an error, the error message will **not** be displayed, and the workflow notifies the user that an error occurred, if appropriate. Use 'Current workflow error' to see the original error message. It has two properties, 'code' and 'message.' 'code' is a short phrase to use in conditions. 'message' is the error message that would display if there were no error workflows. Use 'message' to show the message in an Alert element, for example. Do not use 'message' in conditions since it is language-dependent and can change. 'code' will always be the same no matter what language the app displays. The codes and error messages are listed in the Languages section in the Settings Tab. For error workflows meant to provide a nicer response to unexpected errors, we do not recommend reading data from the database or an external API because if the error is caused by a network or connectivity issue, the error workflow may also fail if it relies on data that cannot be loaded. If the error workflow fails, the user will see an error alert.

Error sources to catch

Choose from 'Any workflow error' and 'Element workflow errors only' to specify whether the event will be triggered by any workflow error (including Do When, When page is loaded, Scheduled events) or just on errors triggered by an element interaction workflow (When element is clicked, when input is changed).

 Element Events

An element is clicked

Watch this video to learn how to use An Element is Clicked Event

This event is triggered when the user clicks on the element. Most visual elements can trigger this event, including texts, buttons, images, and icons.

An input's value is changed

[](https://youtu.be/mDEVJLujlkQ)

Our Academy quick tip on how to trigger workflows from inputs

This event is triggered when the value of an input changes. For text inputs, the event is triggered when the user removes focus from the input.

A map's marker is clicked

Watch this video to learn more about the Map Marker is Clicked Event

This event is triggered when the user clicks a map's marker. 'This map's current marker' refers to the marker the user clicked.

A popup is opened

[](https://youtu.be/AhiJv3jYZEg)

Watch our Academy quick tip on how to start workflows based on a popup

This event is triggered when a popup opens through a 'Show element' action.

A popup is closed

This event is triggered when a popup closes, either through a 'Hide element' action or when the user presses Esc.

An element has an error running a workflow

Watch this video to learn more about this event

This event is triggered when the user interacts with an element, like clicking a button, and an error occurs. This happens for both expected errors, such as a failed login attempt, and unexpected errors, such as a bug with the Bubble platform. If no error workflows are defined, the default is to display an alert with an error message. If at least one error workflow runs successfully, i.e., the condition passes and the workflow runs without an error, the error message will **not** be displayed, and the workflow notifies the user that an error occurred, if appropriate. Use 'Current workflow error' to see the original error message. It has two properties, 'code' and 'message.' 'code' is a short phrase to use in conditions. 'message' is the actual error message that would display if there were no error workflows. Use 'message' to show the message in an Alert element, for example. Do not use 'message' in conditions since it is language-dependent and can change. 'code' will always be the same no matter what language the app displays. The codes and error messages are listed in the Languages section in the Settings Tab. For error workflows meant to provide a nicer response to unexpected errors, we do not recommend reading data from the database or an external API because if the error is caused by a network or connectivity issue, the error workflow may also fail if it relies on data that cannot be loaded. If the error workflow fails, the user will see an error alert. See 'An unhandled error occurs' below to create error handlers that are not element specific.

 Custom Events

Create a custom event...

Bubble allows custom workflows to reuse the same logic in more than one workflow. This event defines that workflow. Name the workflow, and then use a 'Trigger a custom event' action to run this workflow from another workflow. Think about this feature as 'functions' in Bubble.

Event name

Enter the name of the workflow. Select custom workflows in the 'Trigger a custom event' action by name.

Call parameters

If you want the custom workflow to take a thing as an argument, i.e., an entry from the application database, define the type here as a new parameter. If there are mandatory parameters, the 'Trigger a custom event' action prompts you to define which thing(s) should be sent when running the workflow.

----
 Recurring Event

Recurring event

This event is defined in the API section of the app and runs recurring actions on a thing.

Event name

Enter the name of the workflow.

Type of thing

A recurring event requires a thing to run. Define the type here.

Ignore privacy rules when running the workflow

A recurring workflow is run with the current user in context. All privacy rules apply accordingly. Sometimes you want the workflow to bypass these rules and be run as an admin user who has all rights on the data, even when run without authentication. Check this box to bypass the privacy rules set in the Privacy section in the Data Tab.

Warning: Because these are security and privacy options, use this feature with caution.

**Note:** In very rare circumstances, it's possible for a recurring event to get in a bad infinite loop rescheduling itself. If this happens, you can pause the Scheduler, bulk delete all the extraneous scheduled tasks, unpause the Scheduler, and try again.

Timezone selection

Override the recurring event's timezone by setting an alternative timezone with a static or dynamic choice. For this setting to be available you must first enable the setting *Enable timezone override controls* in your app's [general settings](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/application-settings/generaenable-timezone-override-controls).

----
 Trigger Event

Trigger event

Also known as a "database trigger event", this event is defined in the Backend Workflow section and runs workflows triggered by changes in the database. Whenever an item of the given type is modified, we check the "Only when..." condition of the event, and if the condition passes, we run the workflow. This is useful for situations where a given piece of data could be modified by many different places in your application, and you want to make sure something happens each time the data is modified in a specific way. For instance, you could use this to sync the value of certain data types to an external API whenever the data is modified. Trigger events are kicked off by any change to the data, regardless if the change is initiated by a workflow, an API call, or from manually editing the data in the editor.

*Thing before change* and *thing now*

When working with database trigger events, there are two special data types:

- Thing Before Change"
- Thing Now

"Thing" will change to match the type of thing you are working with).

Thing Before Change

Represents the data of the thing that was changed prior to the changes being made. For example, if a User has their first name changed from John to Jane, the *Thing before change* data source will return *John.*

Thing now

This represents the current data (i.e. the data after the change is made). For example, if a User has their first name changed from John to Jane, the *Thing before change* data source will return *Jane.*

If a thing is created or deleted

Triggers are also fired when a thing is created or deleted.

Created

If a thing is created, its *thing before change* data source will return nothing, since there is no former thing to refer to.

Deleted

If a thing is deleted, its *thing after change* data source will return nothing, since the change made to the thing was to remove it altogheter.

Precautions

There are a few caveats and precatutions you should be aware of when using trigger events.

Multiple changes in one workflow

If a workflow modifies a thing multiple times, we only fire triggers once: "Thing Before Change" will be the data at the beginning of the workflow, and "New Thing" will be the data at the end.

Privacy rules

First, although you can use "Current User" to see which user, if any, initiated the workflow that changed the thing, trigger workflows run with full administrative privileges and privacy roles are not applied while the trigger is running, so any searches performed during the workflow will return all results, not just the results the current user is allowed to see.

Triggers cannot kick of other triggers

Triggers cannot kick off other triggers: if data is modified by a workflow initiated by a trigger, we do not check to see if those modifications are eligible for initiating other trigger events.

​

Data source availability

The "Only when..." condition can only use "Thing Now" and "Thing Before Change" instead of the full list of Bubble data sources. The full list of data sources are available in the actions kicked off by the trigger.

**A note on workload:** keep in mind that workflows kicked off by triggers consume server capacity, like any other Bubble workflow. If your application kicks off multiple trigger workflows every time data is modified, this can add up to a lot of overhead to the total capacity used by your application.

To control this, use strict "Only when..." conditions to make sure you are only running trigger workflows when you need to. User manual article series: [Pricing and workload](https://manual.bubble.io/account-and-marketplace/account-and-billing/pricing-plans)​

**Note:** If you have more than 20 database triggers that kick off at once, the remaining triggers will be scheduled to protect your app's infrastructure from consuming too much memory.

Event name

Enter the name of the workflow.

Type of thing

A database trigger event watches a certain type of thing for changes. Define the type here.

Timezone selection

Override the backend trigger's timezone by setting an alternative timezone with a static or dynamic choice. For this setting to be available you must first enable the setting *Enable timezone override controls* in your app's [general settings](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/application-settings/generaenable-timezone-override-controls).

----
 Account

Sign the user up

This action creates a new user in the application database. Signing up a user requires an email and password. Once a user is created, they will be able to login, logout, and information can be saved for that user. It is important to note that when a user signs up, they will be logged in immediately. Their information can be accessed through the Composer using 'Current user's email,' etc.

Email

This is the email used to sign the user up. It is the unique identifier of the user. Usually, this property is the value of an input and looks like 'Input email's value.'

Note: Two users cannot have the same email.

Password

This is the password used to sign the user up. Usually, this property is the value of an input and looks like 'Input password's value.'

Require a password confirmation

Check this box to require users to type their password twice when they sign up to make sure the user did not make a mistake. If you check this box, the form should have two different inputs.

Password Confirmation

This field defines where to find the confirmation of the password. It should be the content of an input that is different from the initial input for the password.

Send an email to confirm the email

Check this box to send an email to the user confirming that their email address is valid and that they can access it. This email contains a link that once clicked will set the user's property 'email confirmed' to yes.

You can customize the content of this email in the *Languages* section in the *Settings* Tab. Look for 'Email confirmation subject' and 'Email confirmation body.' in the list of strings.

Create a token without sending an email

To generate the confirmation token without sending an automated email, check the *Just make token, don't send email* checkbox in the action settings. This allows you to reference the token in a later step in the workflow using *Result of step ] (Send confirmation email ...)* in an expression. Use this if you want to set up your own confirmation email or if you want to link to the confirmation page using the *Go to page* action and including the token parameter.

Example including the token:

[https://yourdomain.com/[CONFIRMATION_PAGE]?confirmation_email=[LONG_ID]](https://yourdomain.com/%5BCONFIRMATION_PAGE%5D?confirmation_email=%5BLONG_ID%5D)

Replace the [CONFIRMATION_PAGE] with the name of the page from the *Send confirmation email* action and the [LONG_ID] with the token that was generated in that same action.

Confirmation page

Enter the page where the user is taken after clicking the link in the confirmation email.

Remember the email

Set this field to true for the browser to remember the email entered in the signup form. In this case, when the user is logged out, the email input will display the last saved email.

Change another field

Click this button to save additional fields for this user. This is equivalent to a 'Make change to current user' or 'Make change to thing' action modifying the current user.

Log the user in

This action logs an existing user in with an email and password. The user must have already signed up for this action to proceed. When successful, this action triggers the event 'The current user is logged in.'

Email

Define where to find the email. Usually, it will be 'Input email's value.'

Password

Define where to find the password. Usually, it will be 'Input password's value.'

Stay logged in

Checking this determines how long the user stays logged in on that device (unless they clear their cookies).

| **Checkbox status** | **Logged in for...** |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Checked             | 365 days             |
| Unchecked           | 24 hours             |

Remember the email

Set this field to true for the browser to remember the email entered in the signup form. In this case, when the user is logged out, the email input will display the last saved email.

Opt-in to cookies

This action is only visible for applications that have enabled the "Do not set cookies on new visitors by default" setting. Call this action to indicate that the user has opted-in to your site storing cookies. Calling this action will create a new, temporary user associated with the current user's web browser, which you can use to store information about the user in between visits to your application. If this action is not called, information stored on the Current User object will be lost whenever the user closes their web browser tab. Note that we need to use cookies to enable signing up or logging in, so on sign up / log in, Bubble implicitly calls this action, even if you don't explicitly call it: if you do not want users to be able to sign up without explicitly opting into cookies, you must prevent them from calling the signup action yourself.

Opt-out from cookies

This action is only visible for applications that have enabled the "Do not set cookies on new visitors by default" setting. This action removes all Bubble-set cookies from the user's web browser, which will log them out of their account if they are currently logged in, and break the association between the user's browser and any temporary user that was created in the database to track them. Calling this action if the user has not previously opted-in to cookies will have no effect.

Signup/login with a social network

This action signs a user up using Facebook, Instagram, or other social network known as an OAuth provider. This action creates a user in the application database but does not use an email/password identification. Instead, Bubble uses a token provided by the OAuth provider. When a workflow hits this action, the user is prompted to approve the access to their information. To use this action, create an application as a developer on Facebook or other provider and copy the keys the provider gives you in the Plugins Tab.

Note: Some providers, such as Google, expect the exact URL to be specified in the Developers Console, including a '/' at the end.

OAuth provider

Choose which service to use for authentication. Install the relevant plugin through the dropdown menu in the Plugins Tab or add an API with the API Connector.

Log the user out

Logs the user out and triggers the 'Current user is signed out' event.

Update the user's credentials

This action changes the user's email and/or password. The system requires the user to type their previous password again for security reasons. When using this action, the interface should have a form for the old password and the new email/password.

[](https://youtu.be/wwHOKUygxHI)

Our Academy course includes how to update the user's credentials

Old password

Enter where to find the old password, which is usually 'Input old password's value.'

Change email

Check this box to allow users to change their email.

Email

Define where to find the new email, which is usually 'Input new email's value.'

Change password

Check this box to allow users to change their password.

New password

Define where to find the new password, which is usually 'Input new password's value.'

Require password confirmation

Check this box if you want users to type their password twice when modifying their credentials to make sure they do not make a mistake. If this box is selected, the form should have two different inputs.

Confirmation

Define where to find the password confirmation, which is usually 'Input new password confirmation's value.'

Do not show success message

By default, Bubble displays an alert informing the user when the action is successful. Deactivate this behavior by deselecting this box if you want to display a custom message instead of the default Bubble message.

Send an email to confirm the email

Check this box to send an email to the user confirming the new email is valid and that the user can access it. This email contains a link that once clicked will set the user's property 'email confirmed' to yes. Customize the content of this email in the Languages section in the Settings Tab. Look for 'Email confirmation subject' and 'Email confirmation body.'

Confirmation page

Enter the page where the user is taken after clicking the link in the confirmation email.

Make changes to current user

This action modifies the current user and saves this information in the application database. This is equivalent to a 'Make change to thing,' modifying the current user.

Changes

List the modifications to apply to the current user. Select the field to modify, the operation, and the new value.

Send confirmation email

This action sends an email to the currently logged-in user to confirm the email is valid and that they can access it. If an email was already confirmed, the user's property 'email confirmed' is marked as unconfirmed until the user clicks the link in the new email. If the user's account has been linked to an OAuth provider (e.g. Google), the user's property 'email confirmed' will automatically be marked as confirmed.

Confirmation page

Enter the page where the user is taken after clicking the link in the confirmation email.

Send password reset email

This action sends an email with a reset link to the user when the password is forgotten. The link goes to the reset_pw page that is built into the Bubble Editor and handles the reset of the password.

Email to reset

Enter the email for where to send the link to reset the password. The form should have an input for the email.

Note: The email should already exist in the database. Otherwise, there is no password to reset.

Subject

Enter the subject of the email.

Body

Enter the content of the email. The reset password link is added to the end of the email.

Just make token, don't send email

In the reset password email, there's a link that looks like [https://yourdomain.com/reset_pw?reset=[LONG_ID]](https://yourdomain.com/reset_pw?reset=%5BLONG_ID%5D). The token is just the LONG_ID part of that link. Manually recreate the link at a later point in time and reset the password then. Tokens can only be used once. This feature adds flexibility. For example, maybe you want an administrator to create an account for someone else and then email them from a personal account rather than having the user receive a system-generated email. Get the LONG_ID as a result of this action in the subsequent actions of the workflow.

Send magic login link

This action sends an email with a magic link to allow a user to login to their account. The link can only be used once to login and will expire after 1 hour. If 2FA is enabled on your app and the requesting user, the user will be directed to complete the required 2FA steps after clicking a valid login link.

**Note:** Some email inboxes automatically screen embedded links for spam, which could mark the magic link as already clicked. End users should be encouraged to allow the magic link email address to their inbox provider’s allowlist to get around these security checks.

Time Expiration (Hrs)

Specify the length of time in hours the login link is valid for, starting from when the link is created (i.e. the user initiates the workflow action). The default value will be 1 hour, but can be any decimal or integer value between 0 and 24.

Session length

When a user logs into the app using a magic login link, they will stay logged in for a period of 365 days. This duration is fixed and cannot be altered at present.

However, there's an exception when two-factor authentication (2FA) is active. In this case, even though the user initially logs in via the magic link, they will be directed to the multi-factor authentication (MFA) page. Here, they have the alternative option to remain logged in for up to 30 days.

Email

Enter the email for where to send the magic link, usually a dynamic value from a form input in your Bubble app. If the email address does not belong to a valid user account, no magic link or email will be sent.

Subject

Enter the subject of the email.

Body

Enter the content of the email.

Magic link text

Enter the text for the magic login link. This text containing the link will be added after the body of the email.

Just create link, don't send email

Check this box if you would like to handle sending the magic link to the user yourself. The magic link will be created on the server side but not sent to an email address. The magic link can be subsequently handled by any server side action (such as included in a custom email action) using "Result of Step N’s Send magic login link".

**Note:** For security reasons, this link will not be available for use on the client side, for example, to display on a page in a text element.

Redirect on success

Specify the page you would like to redirect the user when the user successfully logs in using the magic link. If 2FA is enabled on the user account, this page will be ignored in favor of the manual redirect location specified after your [Check 2fa token](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/actions/accouncheck-2fa-token) action.

Redirect on failure

Specify the page you would like to redirect the user when there is an issue logging the user in using the magic link, such as in the case of an invalid or expired link.

Send data on login

Check this box to send data and/or additional parameters in the url on page navigation after the user successfully logs in.

Send data on failure

Check this box to send data and/or additional parameters in the url on page navigation if the there is an issue logging the user in.

Data to send

Choose the thing for the page content of the destination page. The type of this thing should be consistent with the page's type of content. If the type is inconsistent, the expression will be red. If the page doesn't have a type, you can send text instead to append a path to the URL.

Send more parameters to the page

Additional data can be sent to the page. This can be a text, a number for a search, etc. This option defines the series of key/values to send. The way to use them in the destination page is by using the 'Get data from page URL' data source.

Additional parameters

Define the key/values to send to the destination page.

**Warning:** Because of Bubble's internal logic, do not use 'id,' 'debug_mode,' or 'resume' as keys.

Send current page parameters

If there is any data stored in the page URL parameters when the page changes the parameters will be carried over to the destination page as well. These parameters will be overridden by any parameters with the same name added using the "Send more parameters to the page" option.

Reset password

This action resets the password of a user on the reset_pw page and gives a token for the URL. See 'Just make token, don't send email' above. The token expires after 24 hours.

[](https://youtu.be/msjECJzlJBk)

Our Academy course includes how to build a reset_pw page

Password

Define where to find the password. The reset_pw form is built into the app. If you changed the form, however, define which input contains the password.

Confirmation

Define where to find the confirmation of the password. It should be the content of an input that is different from the initial input for the password.

Create an account for someone else

[](https://youtu.be/gwocxW4OlG4)

Watch our Academy quick tip on to set up an account for someone else

This action creates an account for someone else without logging the new user in. This is useful to create an admin page and control who is allowed to sign up. Access this user in the following actions.

Email

Enter the email of the new user, which usually comes from an input.

Password

Define the password for the new user. Hardcode a value or use an input. Note: This field is deprecated and only available in older apps.

Return the user if the account already exists

When creating a new user that already exists, e.g., the email is already in the application database, the action returns an error. Check this box, and the action will simply return the user so that you can manipulate it in subsequent actions.

Changes

Add the modifications to apply to the new user. Select the field to modify, the operation, and the new value.

Check password for the current user

This action checks a value against the 'Current user's password.' If the password is correct, the workflow continues. Otherwise, it stops and displays a message to the user. Use this to validate the password before an important operation, such as deleting an account.

Password

Define which tentative password should be checked. Usually, it comes from an input element.

Assign a temp password to a user

This action deletes the password of a user and assigns a temporary one. Text is returned by this action and can be used in upcoming workflows. When the user tries to log in using this password, they will be taken to the page defined in the 'Redirect users who haven't changed their password' option in the General section in the Settings Tab.

**Note:** Temporary password do not come with an automatic expiry. They will remain the user's password until the user changes the password as described above.

The original password is deleted and cannot be retrieved.

User

Define which user to assign the password to. It should be of type user. If the type is inconsistent, the expression will be red.

**Important:** This workflow action is meant to be used in a situation where an admin is resetting the password for a user - the admin can see the new password. **We do not recommend building this into an end-user-facing flow on a page** because it is not a secure way to work with passwords. We generally recommend using the reset password action. If you really want an end-user self-serve solution, consider using this action in a backend workflow instead.

Change the email for another user

This action modifies a user's login email. It is intended to be used in administrative workflows to modify the email of a user who may or may not be actively using the app at the time. To enable a user to change their own email, use the 'Update the user's credentials' action. This is more secure because it makes them re-enter their password to confirm that they are actually authorized to perform that action. In contrast, this action is intended for situations where an admin needs to update the account of another user, whose password they don't know.

Warning: Do not include this action in workflows run by ordinary users.

User

Enter the user whose email is being changed.

New email

Enter the new email. The next time this user logs in, they must enter this email rather than their previous email.

Log out other user's sessions

This action lets you log out all sessions of the current user, except the one where the user triggers this action. This is a useful action for security, when you want to make sure no other devices have a logged-in session. If you need to log out the user from the current session as well, you can use a Log the user out action after this action.

**Note:** This action won't immediately refresh the pages of logged-out sessions across all devices. Instead, the pages will update when the device interacts with the server, such as by executing a server-side workflow or retrieving data.

Generate a 2FA QR code

This action lets you generate a unique QR code for a user, so that they can set up two-factor authentication with Google Authenticator or Authy. The user should confirm his/her password first.

Note: This is an advanced feature and only accessible on the Growth plan and above.

Password

To set up two-factor authentication, users need to enter their password to confirm their identity. This property define where to find the existing password.

Validate token and activate 2FA

This action lets the user validate the unique temporary token he will get from Google Authenticator or Authy the first time to validate the flow. Once the user has been through that process, he will be marked as using two-factor authentication and will have to go through the token check step to log in to your application.

Token

This is the token the user wants to validate. It should be coming from an input on the page.

Check 2FA token

This action lets the user validate the unique temporary token he will get from Google Authenticator or Authy. If he goes through that step successfully he will be logged in to the application.

Token

This is the token the user wants to validate. It should be coming from an input on the page.

Valid_30_days

When set to yes, the user will not be required to check his token for another thirty days on the current device/browser.

Disable 2FA for the current user

This action disabled the check for a temporary token for the current user. Once a user has gone through that step, he won't have to enter a temporary code to log in.

Password

To disable two-factor authentication, users need to enter their password to confirm their identity. This property define where to find the existing password.

Token

This is the token the user wants to validate. It should be coming from an input on the page.

Generate one-time backup codes

This action lets you generate 10 unique codes that can be used by the user instead of a temporary two-factor authentication token to log in to his account. This codes can be used only once, and regenerating a list will cancel previous codes. These codes are useful when the user loses his phone, etc.

Password

To disable two-factor authentication, users need to enter their password to confirm their identity. This property define where to find the existing password.

Token

This is the token the user wants to validate. It should be coming from an input on the page.

Number_of_codes

This is the number of codes you want to generate. It defaults to 10.

 Navigation

Go to page ...

This action takes the user to another page and optionally defines which data to send to that page, if the destination page has a type of content. You can choose the page destination from static options (existing page names) or dynamic options (current page or dynamic page).

If the action is to go to the current page but statically specified and with different data to send, the content of the page will be updated without reloading the page. If the action is to go to the current page but dynamically specified, the data already sent to the page will be preserved. If the action is to go to the dynamic page, parameters will be cleared. If a change page action is the only action in a workflow that is triggered on page load, the redirection will happen on the server. Note that if a condition is applied on such an event, the redirection will happen on the server if the condition only involves the Current user and the Current page thing.

If the dynamic expression returns an empty value the action will redirect to the index page. If it returns a non-empty value that doesn't match any page names, it will redirect to the 404 page.

Dynamic page name

If you want the page name to be dynamically specified, you can create a dynamic expression representing the page name here.

Data to send

Choose the thing for the page content of the destination page. The type of this thing should be consistent with the page's type of content. If the type is inconsistent, the expression will be red. If the page doesn't have a type, you can send text instead to append a path to the URL.

Send more parameters to the page

Additional data can be sent to the page. This can be a text, a number for a search, etc. This option defines the series of key/values to send. The way to use them in the destination page is by using the 'Get data from page URL' data source.

Additional parameters

Define the key/values to send to the destination page.

Warning: Because of Bubble's internal logic, do not use 'id,' 'debug_mode,' or 'resume' as keys.

Send current page parameters

If there is any data stored in the page URL parameters when the page changes the parameters will be carried over to the destination page as well. These parameters will be overridden by any parameters with the same name added using the "Send more parameters to the page" option.

Replace the entry in the browser history

When redirecting to the same page and updating the data to send, a new entry is added to the browser history. Check this box if you do not want the initial page included in the list.

User manual article section: [Understanding "Replace the entry in the browser history"](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/navigation/multi-page-applicationunderstanding-replace-the-entry-in-the-browser-history)​

Open in new tab

Checking this will open the page in a new tab.

Refresh the page

This action reloads the page. It is equivalent to the user hitting 'Refresh' in their browser.

**Note:** The *Refresh the page* action resets the current page context and interrupts any ongoing server-side calls tracking workflow progress. Due to potential timing discrepancies, it's recommended to avoid executing workflow steps immediately after this action, since they may fail to run.

Instead, position the *Refresh the page* action as the final step in your workflow, and then use the *Page is loaded* event to trigger any subsequent actions.

Go to previous page

This action goes to the previous page in the browser history. It is equivalent to the user hitting 'Back' in their browser.

Open an external website

This action opens another website.

Open in new tab

Checking this will open the page in a new tab.

Destination

Enter the URL to be opened. Enter a dynamic address using the 'Insert dynamic data' button.

Add a pause before next action

This action pauses the workflow for the number of milliseconds entered. This is useful if you want to wait before animating an element, etc. This will have no impact on actions that happen on the server, like data modifications, sending emails, etc.

Pause length (ms)

Enter the number of milliseconds the workflow should pause.

Hide the status bar as the pause occurs

By default, the status bar is shown during this action. To hide it when the workflow pauses, check this box.

Terminate this workflow

This action, if it runs, immediately ends the workflow. Useful in conjunction with an action condition... if the condition is false, the workflow will continue; if true, the workflow will end. If run in a custom workflow, will terminate that workflow, but not the parent workflow.

 Data (Things)

This is the short-form **technical reference** entry describing how to work with data in Bubble actions. If you are looking for more in-depth and long-form articles on the subject, you may be interested in checking the [Bubble Data manual](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data).

Create a new thing...

This action creates a new entry in the application database, which we refer to as a Thing.

For the "Type" in this action's property editor, select an existing data type from the dropdown or define a new one by selecting 'Create a new type…' in this menu.

For example, you might select 'Event' from your list of data types. Once you do, and this action runs, a new 'Event' *thing* will be created into your application database.

When you click "Set another field," you can either choose from an existing field on that data type or create a new one. For example, if we already created a field for "Event name" in our Data Types tab, we can select this option and set it equal to an input's value. If we want to create a new field for "Start time," we can do so by selecting "Create a New Field" directly from the bottom of this dropdown.

Once you run this action, you can also see the matching changes in your Data tab, under Data Types and App Data.

Type

Choose the type of thing to create. Define a new type by selecting 'Create a new type...' in this dropdown menu.

Initial values

Click 'Add another field' to add a new field and specify a different value for that field. Select the field to modify, the operation, and the new value.

Make changes to thing...

This action modifies an existing entry in the application database. For example, if a user updates their first name, use 'Make change action' to the 'Current user's first name.'

Thing to change

Select which thing to modify.

Create if the thing doesn't exist

By default, this action does nothing if the thing you are trying to change does not already exist. Click this box to change this behavior. In this case, the action will be equivalent to 'Create a new thing' and will use the changes as initial values. Important: If the thing being changed, e.g., the 'Current user's thing,' does not exist, the thing will be created, but it will not be associated with the current user. Warning: This option has been deprecated on Jul 18, 2017. Applications created after this date will not be able to access it (but it will still be applied in run mode). Instead, users can use a condition on the action and create the thing if it does not exist in an action prior to the Change Thing action. We recommend users using this option to follow the same pattern as they upgrade their apps.

Changes

Add the modifications to apply to the thing currently being modified. Select the field to modify, the operation, and the new value. In addition to a simple action that assigns a value, other options are available, depending on the field type. If it is a list, choose from:

**Add**

Adds an item to the existing list. The type of thing should be of the same type as the field. If the item is already in the list, it will not be added.

**Remove**

Remove an item from the existing list. The type of thing should be of the same type as the field. If the item is not in the original list, nothing will happen.

**Set list**

Replace the current list with the new list. The value should be a list of things of the same type.

**Add list**

Add all the entries of the list defined to the existing list. If some items are already in the list, they will not be added.

**Remove list**

Removes all the entries of the list defined from the existing list. If some items are not in the list, they will not be removed.

**Clear list**

Deletes the content of the field and replaces it with an empty list.

Make changes to a list of things...

This action is equivalent to 'Make changes to a thing' but modifies more than one entry. Define a list of things to change, and each entry will be modified as described in the list of changes.

Type of things

Select the type of thing to modify. This is needed to test the type consistency with the actual list.

List to change

Define the list to modify. It can either be the result of a search or the content of a field that is a list of things. If the type is inconsistent, the expression will be red, and the action will not complete.

Changes

List the modifications to apply to the things currently being modified. Select the field to modify, the operation, and the new value.

We are aware that some users employ the "Make changes to a list of things" action to pre-load lists for later workflow reference. Note that this action immediately triggers the query and consumes workload, regardless of whether the results are used in a later step or if only part of the results are used. Because of the potential workload implications, we advise treating this as an advanced feature and using it cautiously. We are working on implementing the concept of a ‘workflow local variable’ to address this use case.

Delete thing...

Deletes a thing from the database.

To delete

Select which thing to delete.

Delete a list of things...

This action is similar to 'Delete thing' but deletes more than one entry.

Type of things

Select the type of thing to delete. This is needed to test the type consistency with the actual list.

List to delete

Define the list to delete. It can either be the result of a search or the content of a field that is a list of things. If the type is inconsistent, the expression will be red, and the action will not complete.

Copy a list of things...

This action duplicates a list of things.

Important: For performance and security reasons, the number of things in the initial list is limited to 100 entries. If the length of the list exceeds this, the action will do nothing.

Type of things

Select the type of thing to copy. This is needed to test the type consistency with the list.

List to copy

Define the list to copy. It can either be the result of a search or the content of a field that is a list of things. If the type is inconsistent, the expression will be red, and the action will not complete.

Set a Thing's slug... [Beta]

This action modifies an existing thing's slug value.

Thing to change

Select the thing to modify.

Slug [Beta]

Specify the new slug value you want the thing to take.

Download data as CSV

This action enables users to download data as CSV. Use this to build your own admin page. End users are prompted to choose a destination for the file. This feature is available to users with a paid Bubble plan.

Type of data

Choose the type of data to export.

Data source

Define the list to export. It can either be the result of a search or the content of a field which is a list of things. If the type is inconsistent, the expression will be red, and the action will not complete.

File name

Enter a file name.

Date formatting

Select the date style to use. Choose from Excel friendly, Full (with time zone), and Custom.

Custom date format

Enter the custom date style to use.

Separator

Select the separator to use in the CSV file.

Include labels in first row

When this box is checked, the first row of the CSV file will include labels for the data.

Use field captions instead of IDs

By default, field IDs, which cannot be changed, are used as the column headers. Change this by checking this box. In this case, the captions defined in the Data Types section in the Data Tab will be used instead.

Note: 'Include labels in first row' must be selected to include the labels in the CSV file.

Wrap values in double quotes

When this box is checked, quotes are put around the data values.

Hidden columns

Select which fields should **not** be included in the CSV file.

Upload data as CSV

This action enables users to upload a CSV file and add the items in the application database. Each column should match a field of the selected type. The fields should be of type text, number, date, address, yes/no, or the unique id of thing in your database (type will be the data type of that thing). Uploading lists of things into one field must be uploaded as a JSON array. Currently, this action does not support uploading an array of things of another data type into one field (i.e. array of unique ids).

Important: This feature is available to users with a paid Bubble plan. This action is limited to uploading a maximum number of items at a time depending on your plan.

Type of data

Select the type of data to upload.

CSV file

Define the expression that points to the file to upload. Typically, it will use a file uploader element.

Separator

Select the separator to use in the CSV file.

Delete an uploaded file

This action deletes an uploaded file in your application storage. Only files uploaded by your application will be deleted. If the file is not found, the action will not do anything. Note that similarly to deleting files from the application editor, deleting a file does not modify things that refer to this file to wipe the URL at the thing level. If you wish to do this, you should do this first in your workflow.

Warning: Use this feature with caution as it permanently deletes your file. **You will not be able to recover the deleted files**.

File URL

URL of the file to delete. It should look like [https://s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf//](https://s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf//)... or [https://domain.com/fileupload/](https://domain.com/fileupload/)... for private files. Note that if the current user does not have permission to read the file, he will not be able to delete it.

 Email

**Note:** Due to rate limiting from Sendgrid on the default shared email address, a maximum of 50 recipients can be specified per email. If you need more than this limit for your app, consider creating your own Sendgrid account as outlined [here](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/navigating-the-bubble-editor/tabs-and-sections/settings-tab/application-settings/emaisetting-up-sendgrid).

Send email

This action sends an email from the app. If a domain name has not been setup yet, the email will come from [your-appname]-no-reply@bubbleapps.io. When a domain name is set, the email will come from what_you_want@your_domain.com. Customize this email in the Domain & Email section in the Settings Tab.

**Note:** A domain name must be set up before customizing email behavior. Custom domains are available on Personal plans or higher.

To

Specify the email to send the email to. It can either be 'Current user's email' or the content of an input. Send more than one email at once by defining a list of emails and using the 'join' property with a comma ','.

 Element

Show an element

Shows an element or popup. If the element is a container, the elements inside will be shown as well.

Hide an element

Hides an element or popup. If the element is a container, the elements inside will be hidden as well.

Animation (native app)

When building a native app, use native animations when a group is hidden, like sliding, etc. This provides a more native experience. Choose from None, Slide, and Flip.

Animation direction

Select the direction of the animation. Choose from Left, Right, Up, and Down.

Toggle an element

Use this action to toggle an element or popup. If the element is visible, it will be hidden. If the element is hidden, it will become visible.

Our Academy quick tip on how to scroll to an element

Offset (pixels)

Enter a number in pixels to offset the scroll position. This is useful for a floating header that is near the top of the screen.

Animate an element

Use this action to animate elements on the page. The 'transition' animation hides or shows the element as an action would do.

[](https://youtu.be/Jg72ztXqBGA)

Our Academy quick tip on how to animate elements

Animation

Choose the animation to use. A thumbnail shows allowing you to preview the animation.

Define a custom duration

By default, animations have a preset length. Check this box to override this setting.

Duration (ms)

Enter the animation duration in milliseconds.

Set state of an element

Assign custom states to elements to store additional information. For example, the current tab that a group shows, etc. This action modifies the value of the state. Use the state of an element in the Conditional section in the Property Editor to change how it displays based on the value of the custom state.

Custom state

Select the state to modify. Create a new state by selecting 'Create a new custom state...' in the dropdown menu.

Value

This is the value to assign to the custom state. It should be of the type of the custom state defined when the state was created.

Set another state

Click this button to set another custom state for this element.

Set focus to an input element

This action sets the focus to an input. If the input is not currently visible on the screen, the page will automatically scroll to the input.

On an iOS device, even if this action is used, the keyboard will not appear until the user interacts with the page in some way.

Reset relevant inputs

This action wipes the content of the inputs that were used in the workflow with this action. This is useful if you do not want users to click twice and run the workflow twice. The result inputs will either be empty or contain the default value defined for each of them.

Cancel upload of a file uploader

Cancel an in-progress upload of a file uploader. You can check if an upload is in progress using the 'is loading' state on the uploader.

Show message in an alert box

This action shows an alert. It is different from the Show element action because the element is shown with a fade in and fade out animation.

Fade in (ms)

Enter the length of the fade-in animation in milliseconds.

Hold (ms)

Enter the number of milliseconds to keep the alert visible.

Fade out (ms)

Enter the length of the fade-out animation in milliseconds.

Change the alert message

Check this box to overwrite the message defined at the Alert element level.

Message

Enter the new message to display.

Display data in a group/popup

This action defines which data a group or popup should use, provided a type of content was defined at the element level. It overwrites the data source set at the group/popup level. It also resets the data of any inputs or groups that are children of this element.

Data to display

Select the thing to be displayed in this group or popup. If the type isn't consistent with the element's type, the expression will be red or a popup will prompt you to change the element's type.

Reset a group/popup

This action resets a group or popup. When this happens, the data source reverts to what was initially set at the element's level, and the inputs are deleted.

Display list in a repeating group

This action defines which list of things a repeating group displays. It overwrites the data source set at the element level.

Data source

This defines the list of things that should be displayed in the repeating group. If the type isn't consistent with the element's type, the expression will be red or a popup will prompt you to change the element's type.

Known Issue

With large repeating groups, especially ones showing a lot of data per cell (e.g. images), if the data source changes while the repeating group is visible, what's shown in the repeating group might have a visual lag as it refreshes in chunks. To mitigate this, consider hiding the repeating group, then changing the data source, then showing the repeating group again.

Clear list in a repeating group

Reset the list of a repeating group to what is defined at the repeating group's level. If no data source was defined at the element's level, the list will be empty.

Show next of a repeating group

When using the group in a 'Fixed number of cells' layout, use this action to go to the next page in the repeating group.

Wrap around

If checked, the repeating group will display the first page after displaying the last one so that users can keep moving through the pages.

Show previous of a repeating group

When using the group in a 'Fixed number of cells' layout, use this action to go to the previous page in the repeating group.

Wrap around

If checked, the repeating group will display the first page after displaying the last one so that users can keep moving through the pages.

Go to page of a repeating group

When using the group in a 'Fixed number of cells' layout, use this action to jump to a given page in the repeating group.

Page

This number, which can be dynamic, is the page to go to. If the length is shorter than the entered number, it will go to the last page.

Scroll to entry of a repeating group

Scrolls a repeating group so that a given entry is at the top of the list. This doesn't work with repeating groups in the 'Fixed number of cells' layout. In Infinite scroll mode, the list is scrolled to the correct position. In Full list mode, the entire page will be scrolled so that the entry is at the top of the screen.

Entry to scroll to

This is the entry to scroll to. If it is not in the list, nothing will happen. It should be of the same type as the repeating group.

Animate the scrolling

Check this box to apply a 300-milliseconds animation as the page/list scrolls.

Vertical offset (pixels)

By default, this action will scroll so that the entry is at the top of the element (or the screen). If you need to add an offset, for instance if a header is at the top of the screen, you can enter a number of pixels there.

Display markers on a map

This action overwrites the list of places a map shows. It takes a list of things that contain a geographic address and displays them on the map. When doing so, the zoom of the map is adjusted automatically to show all markers.

Data source

Define the list of things that should be displayed on the map. If the type isn't consistent with the map's type, the expression will be red or a popup will prompt you to change the element's type.

Set current map marker for a map

This action sets the currently selected map marker on a map. Only works for maps that are displaying a list of markers. When this action is run, the map's 'current marker' will change to the value of 'To select'. If the map is configured to display custom map markers for the selected item, and the value of 'To select' corresponds with a marker currently visible on the map, that marker will be visibly selected. Also, if 'Show title window' is turned on, the title window will be shown if it was currently hidden. Otherwise, there won't be a visible change to the map.

To select

The map marker to select. Must be the same type of thing currently displayed as the map's list.

Clear markers on a map

This action clears the map and uses the data source defined at the map level.

Adjust map zoom

This action automatically adjusts the map zoom so that all markers are visible.

Set center and zoom manually

By default, the action adjusts the zoom and center so that all markers on the map are shown. Check this box to define the zoom and center manually.

Map centered on

This is the address used to center the map.

Initial zoom

This is the zoom level applied to the map.

 Custom

Trigger a custom event

This action triggers a custom event, which should be defined on the page already. These events are a way to share workflows/actions between the different workflows of the page.

Custom event

Select the custom event to trigger.

Workflow parameters

These are the parameters defined at the Custom Event level.

Trigger a custom event when data changes

This action:

- Looks for a change in a specific field of a given data type
- Triggers a custom event when a change is happening

The action relies on the parameter set in the Custom Event that is triggered when something changes to define the data type. For instance, if the Custom Event has a parameter set to the User type, this action can be employed to execute when a particular user's data is updated.

Keep in mind that:

- The event will only trigger for as long as the page remains open and must be called again if it's closed
- The event will only trigger once for each call of the action

Custom event

Select the custom event to trigger when the thing changes.

Parameter

This is the thing to watch for changes. It must be the same type as the parameter of the custom event that will be triggered, and the thing will be sent to the custom workflow. In other words, if the custom event expects a user, this field must be a user, and the custom workflow runs with that user when it changes.

Field

This is the field we are watching for changes. For example, if the workflow thing is the 'Current user,' and the field is the 'Name,' then if someone changes the 'Current user's name' from Bob to Barbara, the custom event is triggered.

Schedule a custom event

This action runs the selected custom workflow at a set time in the future. If the user changes the page before the workflow is scheduled to run, it will not happen. Unlike 'Trigger a custom event,' workflows run by this action run independently from and possibly in parallel with the workflow that initiated it.

Custom event

This is the event that is triggered.

Workflow parameters

These are the parameters defined at the Custom Event level.

Delay

Enter the time in seconds to wait before running the custom workflow. Fractional times are accepted.

Trigger a custom event from a reusable element

This action triggers a custom event that belongs to a reusable element. These events are a way to share workflows/actions between the different pages and reusable elements of the app. Defining them in a reusable element is a way to build a library of workflows.

Reusable element

Choose the reusable element to use in the custom workflow.

Custom event

Choose the custom event to trigger. Only custom events from the selected reusable element will appear.

Workflow parameters

These are the parameters defined at the Custom Event level.

Schedule API Workflow

This action allows you to schedule the run of an API workflow at a later time. Use this action to send an email to a user a week after signing up or a reminder a week before an event they created.

This action uses the Bubble API Workflow. You can choose from API workflows with [manually defined parameters.](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/the-bubble-api/defining-the-apmanual-definition) Schedule an API workflow within another API workflow. To avoid infinite loops, it cannot refer to itself. In this case, the subsequent calls are ignored.

Note: This action is available to users with a paid Bubble plan. Activate the API in the API section in the Settings Tab.

API Workflow

Select the API workflow to run. These are the workflows defined in the Backend workflows page found in the Application Menu above the Palette. If the workflow takes parameters, they are displayed in the Property Editor.

Scheduled date

Define the date for the workflow execution. Use the expression Composer to define a dynamic date.

Ignore privacy rules when running the workflow

A scheduled workflow runs in the context of the current user when it is scheduled. All privacy rules apply to that user. To bypass these rules and run as an admin user who has all rights to the data, check this box.

Warning: Because these are security and privacy options, use this feature with caution.

Workflow parameters

These are the parameters defined at the API Workflow level.

Schedule API Workflow on a list

This action allows you to schedule the run of an API workflow at a later time, on a list of things. This is useful to iterate on a list of things. Each workflow runs on a single item in the list and each counts as one workflow run.

Note: This action is available to users with a paid Bubble plan. Activate the API in the API section in the Settings Tab.

Type of things

Select the type of things to iterate on.

List to run on

Define the list to iterate on. It can be the result of a search, an API call, etc. Note: the list is defined and evaluated at scheduling time. In other words, if a thing matches the search constraints when the scheduling happens and subsequently gets modified in a way that it doesn't anymore, the API workflow will still run on it.

API Workflow

Select the API workflow to run. These are the workflows defined in the Backend workflows page found in the Application Menu above the Palette. If the workflow takes parameters, they are displayed in the Property Editor.

Scheduled date

Define the date for the workflow execution. Use the expression Composer to define a dynamic date.

Interval (seconds)

When you run an API workflow on a list of things, there must be a delay between each workflow. Enter the number of seconds to be applied. If left blank, Bubble will calculate the best interval in order to keep the system healthy.

Note: Entering a number below 5 seconds is not recommended.

Ignore privacy rules when running the workflow

A scheduled workflow runs in the context of the current user when it is scheduled. All privacy rules apply to that user. To bypass these rules and run as an admin user who has all rights to the data, check this box.

Warning: Because these are security and privacy options, use this feature with caution.

Workflow parameters

These are the parameters defined at the API Workflow level.

Cancel a scheduled API Workflow

This action cancels a scheduled workflow. The workflow is identified by the number returned by the scheduling action.

Scheduled API ID

Enter the ID, which will most likely be an expression, that contains the ID of the scheduled workflow to cancel.

Cancel a list of scheduled API Workflows

This action cancels a list of scheduled workflows. The workflows are identified by the number returned by the scheduling action.

List of scheduled API IDs

Define the expression that will return the dynamic list of IDs, which should be a list of texts.

Set/cancel a recurring event

This action schedules or cancels a recurring workflow on a thing. This is useful if you want to run something daily, monthly, etc. Only one recurring event can be used per database thing. A frequency of None cancels a recurring event.

Recurring event

Select the event to run periodically or cancel. These events should be defined in the API Workflow page found in the Application Menu above the Palette.

Workflow thing

Each recurring workflow should have a thing attached to it. This thing should be of the same type as the recurring event.

Frequency

Select the frequency to apply to the recurring workflow. Choose from None, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, and Yearly. A frequency of None cancels a recurring event.

Note: A Bubble Personal plan is required for monthly events. A Professional or Production plan is required for Daily events.

Start date

Select the date to start the recurring event. When running this action on a thing that has already been scheduled, the start date has to be after the original next run date. If not, it will be pushed back by another period.

 Data

Most Bubble apps will be managing data stored in a database. This section of the reference covers how you access data, manages and compares results, searching and setting up security.

Data sources: the source from which you fetch data

Data sources are where you get your data from when building a dynamic expression. It is going to be the first section of the expression. Sources of data can be the current user, a search from the database, data from an external API, some page and browser information, etc.

​[List of data sources](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/data-sources)​

Operators and comparisons: change, evaluate and compare data

Operators and comparisons are used to work with the results of the data from the data source. For example:

**Change (manipulate the data in real-time)**

- Change a text to uppercase
- Add a number to an existing number
- Add a number of days to a date

**Evaluate/compare (return a yes or a no)**

- Check if data has a certain value (i.e. *Name* equals *John*)
- Check if the current user is logged in
- Check if a date is bigger than today's date
- Check if the current user's age is the same as another user's age

​[List of Operators and Comparisons](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/operations-and-comparisons)​

​[Search](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/search): find the data you are looking for in the database

Searching is used to find specific data in the database. To do that, you instruct Bubble:

- What kind of data you are looking for (i.e. *Users* or *Products*)
- Provide constraints

​[List of search tools and settings](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/search)​

​[Privacy:](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/privacy) setting up your database securely to maintain your user's privacy

Privacy and security are cornerstones of all apps that handle sensitive data.

​[List of privacy rule settings](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/privacy)​

​

**Privacy and security** can be a very important part of your app's structure, and we highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with the different tools Bubble offers. The core reference explains each setting, but if you are new to the subject, we encourage you to read through our user manual security guide:

 Data Sources

Data sources are where you get your data from when building a dynamic expression. It is going to be the first section of the expression. Sources of data can be the current user, a search from the database, data from an external API, some page and browser information, etc.

Current user

This represents the current user using the app. The user can either be logged in, in which case you have access to their email, etc., or logged out. If the user is logged out, you can still modify the user object, but once the user closes their browser, you will not be able to access the user's information.

Signed up users

If a user has signed up to Bubble (with an email and a password), a permanent entry is created in the database using this email and password. When a user opens your app in a new browser (without cookies) and enters his credentials through a login workflow, he will be logged in. The value of 'Current user is logged in' will return yes. If you modify the current user, this will be saved permanently on the database object, and if the user logs in on another device, he/she will have the changes applied to his account there as well.

One important consequence of this is that all users that can be found through searches in the database will be marked as 'logged in' on the server, as they are permanent accounts.

Temporary users

As soon as a Bubble app is opened in a browser, a user session is created. If a user already logged in and hasn't cleared the cookies, the session will be using the same user as before, but in the case of a fresh session (without a logged-in user), a temporary user will be created. This user will be marked as 'not logged in' (in other words, 'Current user isn't logged in' will return yes).

The temporary user behaves like a signed-up user, in the sense that you can modify them, and it will be saved to the application database. If a user comes back using the same browser and hasn't cleared the cookies, any value that you have used to modify a field on the user will be the same. Bubble automatically clears temporary user data, though. After three days, such a user will be deleted, and when a user opens a session in the same browser, a new temporary user will be created, for three days.

When a user first visits an application, they will be seen as a temporary user. If they go through a sign-up workflow, the current temporary user will become a signed-up user and will be saved permanently in the database. This has some important consequences in terms of workflow design. Imagine you have a workflow that asks a user for their age before they sign up and saves it to the 'Current user'. If the user effectively signs up within three days, the permanent user that will be created then will have the same 'age'.

Do a search for

[](https://youtu.be/-2_3kuyOxkw)

Our Academy quick tip on how to do a search for your data source

Use this to search for entries in the application database. Define what type of things to look for, which will either be User or a custom data type defined by you, and also specify a sorting order and constraints. The constraints can be on any field, such as name contains 'peter,' address is within 1 mile from the 'User's current position,' etc.

Please note that database queries (ie. “Do a search for”) are bound to a 5 second limit, so anything that takes longer than this to execute will trigger a timeout and subsequent error. For example, some “heavy” queries might look like:

- Searches on data types with over several hundred entries
- Searches on data types with custom fields containing several hundred entries
- Searches involving multiple :filters, :sorts, advanced filters, and/or complex search constraints

To prevent against this, we recommend following the best practices outlined here for building more efficient queries: [General principles & tips about performance](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/optimizing-an-application/performance-and-scaling?q=performancgeneral-principles-and-tips-about-performance).

Perform a search using Algolia

Use this to search entries in your Algolia indices. Define the type you want to search across and what field to query, as well as the query itself

Get an option

Get either a specific option from any option set, or a list of all options from that set.

Arbitrary text

Use this to manually enter a static or dynamic string of text. The text entered will resolve to type Text and can be further modified with any of our text type operators.

Arbitrary date/time

Use this to manually enter a date/time. Most human-readable formats can be parsed.

Get data from an external API

This option fetches data from the outside world through one of Bubble's Plugins. For example, Google Places returns a list of places based on an address and a term, i.e., what you're looking for. Usually, an API call will require parameters. Define what they should be in the Slidable Palette. These parameters can be dynamic, using 'Insert dynamic data.' The type of data this source returns depends on the plugin. It can be a list of places to display on a map or in a repeating group, a single entry to display in a group or text, etc.

Parent group's thing / Current cell's thing

This is a way to refer to the 'Parent element's value.' For example, when using a repeating group that displays a list of users, each cell will have a different user in it. The 'Current cell's user' will represent that user. The type is the type of content of the container.

Current cell's index

This allows access to the number of the current cell in a repeating group. The first cell will be 1, the second will be 2, etc. This is useful to display a rank or change the formatting of some elements based on the number.

Current page thing

If you have set up a page to have a type of content, this source is a way to refer to it. For example, when building a rental marketplace, you will likely have a page with the details of each apartment. This page will have a type of content 'Apartment,' and then a link will open that page sending a given 'Apartment' to it. Refer to the 'Current page's apartment' with this option. Then, you will have access to all the data that the apartment has, such as picture, address, etc.

Element

This source is a way to refer to an element and access its states, like hovered, value, etc. For example, this is how to get an input's value.

This element

This source is a shortcut to find the current element being editing. You then have access to its states.

Result of previous step

This is a way to refer to the result of a previous step/action in a workflow. For example, when using a 'Create a new thing' action to create an 'Apartment,' the subsequent actions will be able to refer to the result of step one and use the new 'Apartment.'

Current Workflow thing

When using custom workflows, you may want a workflow to modify an object you sent to it. The Current Workflow thing is this object. Its type will be the type of the custom workflow being used.

Thing Now

Thing Now represents the new state of the data after a data change, used in the context of a data change trigger workflow. It's up to date with the latest state of the thing and can change over the course of the workflow.

Thing Before Change

When the data changes, you may want to access the old state of the data throughout your data change trigger workflow. Thing Before Change is the data from before the data change.

Get data from page URL

This source is a way to capture the value of a parameter in the URL of the current page or path. For example, the current page's URL is '[yourdomain.com/yourpage?age=23.'](http://yourdomain.com/yourpage?age=23.') Set the source to get the 'age' parameter, and in Live mode, that will return 23. When specifying a parameter, it is case sensitive. We recommend using all lowercase and avoiding special characters, spaces, etc.

If you select path, you can retrieve 'hello' in the URL '[yourdomain.com/yourpage/hello.'](http://yourdomain.com/yourpage/hello.') Choose the type of data that this parameter should have, and then use this data as such in the Bubble Editor. If you choose a type of data that is a custom type or the type User, the value of the parameter in the URL should be the thing ID, not its [slug](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/navigation/page-slugs). Caution: This is an advanced feature.

**Note**: Because URLs only allow some characters, special characters are encoded with a percent symbol preceding an identifier for that character. For example, spaces may become `"%20"` in the browser.

When using the Get data from page URL operator to extract a parameter with a space in it, we will return the parameter as it appears in the URL, not as it is normally written . For example, we we wanted to extract the value of "param" from the following URL:

`website.com/mypage?param=my%20parameter => my%20parameter`

However, when using the Get data from page URL operator to extract the path, we will return the path parsed as it is normally written, not as it appears in the browser. For example, if we wanted to extract the path from the following URL:

`http://website.com/mypage/this%20path => this path`

Current option/thing

Some elements allow access to the current option. For example, when using a dropdown element with dynamic options, e.g., users, you want to define how to name the different options. Choose 'Current option's email' to have the dropdown menu show a list of the users' emails.

API workflow parameters

These are the different parameters the API workflow has access to. When working on an API workflow, define parameters at the Event level with a value. Choose the relevant entry in the top section of the dropdown menu to access the value of the parameter.

Calculate formula

This source calculates more sophisticated numerical calculations, like loan interests, etc. Reach out to us if you need more options.

Page data

This source allows access to the page information.

**Website home URL**

This returns the home of the app. If the user is on [https://yourdomain.com/a_page](https://yourdomain.com/a_page), it will return [https://yourdomain.com](https://yourdomain.com).

**This URL**

This returns the exact URL of the current page.

**Tip:** If you use this as a data source on your live app, use this on [yourdomain.com](http://yourdomain.com) rather than [yourdomain.com/version-live/](http://yourdomain.com/version-live/) to prevent /version-live/ from being included in this link.

**Current language**

This returns the current language the app is using. This can be controlled in a few ways, by order of priority: – `lang` parameter: Set `&lang=english`, for instance, as a querystring in the URL. – A field on the current user: If you set a field in the Languages section in the Settings Tab and modify this field for the current user, this value will be the current language. – The app's primary language: Defined in the Languages section in the Settings Tab. In each case, if the value returned is not one of the available options as shown in the dropdown menu in the Languages section in the Settings Tab, the next option will be used.

**Current page name**

This returns the current page name. Use it in reusable elements, so that the element can have knowledge of the page it is used in.

**Website admin email**

This returns the admin email of the app. Without a paid Bubble plan or domain, the email will be [your-appname]-no-reply@bubbleapps.io. With a paid Bubble plan and domain, the email will be what is set in the Domain & Email section in the Settings Tab. Use this instead of hardcoding the email because it can change over time, such as signing up for a paid Bubble plan.

**Current date/time**

This returns the current time on the user's computer. The type is date.

**Current geographic position**

This returns the current geographic position of the user, provided it is shared. The browser will prompt the user to do so. The type is geographic address.

**Tip:** If you use "Current geographic position" in a workflow, the user will need to accept geolocation in order for that workflow to run successfully.

**Current page width**

This returns the page width in pixels. This is useful when building responsive pages.

**Current page scrolling position**

This returns the number of pixels between the top and current page scroll position.

**Page loaded above fold**

This returns no/false initially, and then true when every element is visible above the fold, i.e., visible given the height of the user's web browser and has finished loading any data needed to display it. Use this to selectively cover things up until the entire page is ready to be displayed to avoid ugly loading artifacts.

Note: If an element starts as invisible while this is false, it will not start loading until this becomes true. So, to hide a slow-loading element, cover it up with something else, such as a Shape element.

**Page loaded (entire)**

This returns no/false initially, and then true when every element is visible on the page and has finished loading any data needed to display it. Use this to selectively cover things up until the entire page is ready to be displayed to avoid ugly loading artifacts.

Note: If an element starts as invisible while this is false, it will not start loading until this becomes true. So, to hide a slow-loading element, cover it up with something else, such as a Shape element.

**Is** Dev environment

This returns yes/true when the app is in any branch of the Development environment.

**Branch name**

This returns the current branch name. The Main branch is always called *version-test*.

Application Text

When handling more than one language for the app, define Text IDs and use them in the Bubble Editor. Then, set the language in the Languages section in the Settings Tab. For example, when adding a new button, in the dropdown menu to define the text, select 'Insert dynamic data' and then 'App text (?).'

Incompatible type for inputs

If an input doesn't have the right type of data, you will not be able to choose it in the dropdown menu. For example, when you want to do a search on the creator of the thing you're searching and want the creator to equal the value of a dropdown menu that lists users. If you haven't set the type of the dropdown element to user properly, you will not be able to select it. The way to select it is to change the type of element at the Dropdown element level.

 Operators and comparisons

Shared operators

These operators are shared among all types of data.

**Note:** Bubble does its best to match the 'type' when a custom value is used with the "is" or "is not" operators. For example, in the dynamic expression *MyNumber Input's Value is "6"*, Bubble will treat the "6" as a number since the input is of type Number. If you were to change the input to type Text without changing the dynamic expression, it may register as a missing value in the Issue Checker. If this happens, re-enter the custom value.

**... is ...**

This checks whether two entries are equal or not. If so, yes is returned.

**... is not ...**

This checks whether two entries are equal or not. If not, yes is returned.

**... is empty**

This checks whether the entry is empty, i.e., has no content.

**... is not empty**

This checks whether the entry is not empty, i.e., has content.

:formatted as JSON-safe

This operator sanitizes a text string, date, yes/no, or list of texts into a JSON-acceptable format by escaping characters *(adding a \ so it is not recognized)* that would otherwise break expected JSON formatting. This includes characters like line breaks, double quotations, or tabs. For more technical users familiar with Javascript, we are using the JSON.stringify() method in the backend.

- When used on a text, the operator will wrap the text in quotations and escape any breaking characters in the middle of the text.
- When used on a yes/no value, the operator will convert the value into true or false, as most 3rd party services only know how to handle true/false, not yes/no.
- When used on a list of texts, the operator will add quotation marks around each text list entry (and escape any breaking characters).
- When used on a date, the operator will convert the input date to the equivalent of `“myDate:formatted_as ISO simplified, UTC”`. For example: Jun 17, 2021 12:34 pm → "2021-06-17T10:35:22.941Z"

**Note:** This method is only suitable for use in sanitizing a text string, a date, yes/no, or a list of texts. It is not designed to support the use case where a user builds a partial or entire json-style object in a multi-line input or :formatted_as_text editor canvas as this operator will escape the double quotes around key value pairs (”) that are otherwise required. Consider instead using Find & Replace ( \ → \) to escape line breaks if you wish to pass the value of a pre-formatted multi-line input as the key value in an API call.

Example of a pre-formatted multi-line input

Text type

**is in**

Returns true if the value is present in the argument list.

**is not in**

Returns true if the value is not present in the argument list.

**... contains**

This operation tests if the first entry contains the argument. The substring of text should match the sequence of characters of the first entry exactly, including case. This search respects the order of the words in the entry. For example, searching for 'cat', 'hat', 'cat in', 'cat in the', 'in the hat', 'at in', or 'cat in the hat' would all return the phrase 'the cat in the hat'. However, searching for 'cat the hat', 'cat hat', or 'Cat' would not return 'the cat in the hat'. This search is useful for returning exact matches for partial words, like searching 'pepp' and returning 'peppers'.

**... doesn't contain**

This operation tests if the first entry does not contain the argument. It behaves as the opposite of the 'contains' constraint described above.

**... contains keyword(s)**

This operator tests whether some text contains certain words. It takes the argument supplied, breaks it up into component words, removes any 'stop' words (short, common words like 'the' or 'a'), and looks for the resulting word(s). For example, searching for ‘cat hat’, ‘cat in hat’, ‘cat in the hat’, ‘the hat cat’, or ‘hat cat’ would return ‘the cat in the hat’. This does not respect partial words that are not of the same stem, so 'pepp' would not return 'peppers'.

To emphasize, this operator will ignore any short, common words for the search. These short, common words are known as "stop words", and an example of such a list (though this is more illustrative, and not the definitive list involved in Bubble's text searches) can be found [here](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/snowball/stopwords/english.stop).

**... doesn't contain keyword(s)**

This operator behaves as the opposite of 'contains keyword(s)' above.

**:capitalized words**

Returns the text with the first letter of each word capitalized. For example, 'this is bob' becomes 'This Is Bob.'

**:uppercase**

Returns the text with the all letters capitalized. For example, 'helLo' becomes 'HELLO.'

**:lowercase**

Returns the text with all lowercase letters. For example, 'HelLo' becomes 'hello.'

**:append**

Returns the concatenation of the text and the argument.

**:formatted as ...**

Formats a text in a specific way. Choose from US Phone, URL Encoded, and MD5 Hash.

**:used as ...**

Uses the URL based text as a file or image representation.

**:trimmed**

Removes the spaces at the beginning and end of the text. For example, ' fd ' becomes 'fd.'

**:number of characters**

Returns the number of characters of a text.

**:truncated to**

Only keeps the first X characters of a text. For example, if you have "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: truncated to 5," this will return "super."

**:truncated from end to**

Only keeps the last X characters of a text. For example, if you have "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: truncated from end to 5," this will return "cious."

**:extract...**

Extracts text from a text. For example, extract the domain name of an email.

**:converted to number**

Converts a text value containing numbers into a number value. It takes the user's browser locale setting into consideration for deciphering symbols denoting decimal and thousands separators

:split by...

Returns a List of Texts version of the original string of text, using the argument as the separator between the items. Using a `line_break` separator will recognize each new line as a separate entry.

**:find/replace...**

Dynamically defines text to use in find and replace. It returns a new text. The find and replace happens for the entire text.

**:extract with Regex**

This is an advanced feature that extracts entries from a text using a Regular Expression (regex). For example, if the regex is `@\S+`and the text is '@one_name and @another_name,' this returns a list of texts: @one_name, @another_name.

**Tip:** This returns a full list of matches, so sometimes it may return the whole text if that's also a match.

**Tip:** Bubble uses JavaScript Regex, which handles certain expressions differently than other flavors (such as PHP). Similarly, we do not yet expose capture groups so your expressions might need a little more massaging. For example, consider the following scenario:

You'd like to extract all of the characters in the following url`https://domain.com/abc/text-that-i-want` after the pattern 'abc/'. A commonly used expression might be `abc\/(.*)`. Used in Bubble, this would extract 'abc/text-that-i-want'. Thus, we need to adjust the expression to (?<=abc/)(.*) to exclude the 'abc/' using a positive lookbehind. This would leave us with just 'text-that-i-want'.

We recommend using a [Regex builder](https://regex101.com/) to test your expressions before using them in Bubble.

**:defaulting to**

Returns a default value if the original text is empty.

Number type

**Tip:** Numbers on computers are stored in scientific notation and in binary, which means that sometimes the result that you get from a calculation can be off from what you expect. To help ensure that you have a number as close as possible to the expected mathematical result, Bubble automatically rounds the final output of math calculations to 15 significant figures before it is displayed or translated to a non-number type.

​

Note that if you're performing operations with an end result of more than 15 significant figures, the additional digits may be cut off due to this rounding operation. You can retrieve the additional digits by using the `:formatted as` operator.

**is in**

Returns true if the value is present in the argument list.

**is not in**

Returns true if the value is not present in the argument list.

**:formatted as ...**

Formats a text in various ways. Caution: Once a number is formatted, it is considered text and cannot be used for calculations.

**... > ...**

Returns yes if the first number is greater than the second number.

**... ≥ ...**

Returns yes if the first number is greater than or equal to the second number.

**... < ...**

Returns yes if the first number is less than the second number.

**... ≤ ...**

Returns yes if the first number is less than or equal to the second number.

**... + ...**

Sums the first and second number.

**... - ...**

Subtracts the second number from the first number.

**... * ...**

Multiplies the first number by the second number.

**... / ...**

Divides the first number by the second number.

**:rounded to**

Rounds the first number so that it has X digits after the decimal. For example, '0.234' becomes '0.23' with an argument of '2,' and '0.5' becomes '1' with an argument of '0.'

**:floor**

Rounds the number down to the nearest integer. For example, floor '1.234' becomes '1,' and floor '-2.3' becomes '-3.'

**:ceiling**

Rounds the number up to the nearest integer. For example, ceil '1.234' becomes '2,' and ceil '-2.3' becomes '-2.'

**... ^ ...**

This defines an exponential equation. The first number is the base, and the second number is the exponent. For example, '2 ^ 3' becomes '8.'

**<- range ->**

Generates a number range from two numbers and returns a range whose lower bound is the smaller of the two numbers and the higher bound is the larger one.

**... <- max -> ...**

Returns the larger of the two numbers.

**... <- min -> ...**

Returns the smaller of the two numbers.

**... <- modulo -> ...**

Returns the remainder when the first number is divided by the second number. For example, '5 <- modulo -> 2' becomes '1.' Tip: Use this to figure out if a number is odd or even.

Number range type

When set to range, the slider input returns two numbers. The type is number range.

**is in**

Returns true if the value is present in the argument list.

**is not in**

Returns true if the value is not present in the argument list.

**:min**

Returns the start of the range, the smallest value.

**:max**

Returns the end of the range, the largest value.

**:average**

Returns the center of the range by averaging the start and end.

**contains range**

Takes a first range and a second range. Returns yes if the first range contains the second range. "Contains" means that the start of the second range is greater than or equal to the start of the first range, and the end of the second range is less than or equal to the end of the first range. So, if the two ranges are the same, then this will return yes.

**contains point**

Takes a range and a single number. Returns yes if the number is contained by the range. It is contained if it is greater than or equal to the start of the range and less than or equal to the end of the range.

**is contained by**

Takes a first range and a second range. Returns yes if the first range is contained by the second range. "Contains" means that the start of the first range is greater than or equal to the start of the second range, and the end of the first range is less than or equal to the end of the second range. So, if the two ranges are the same, then this will return yes.

**overlaps with**

Takes a first range and a second range. Returns yes if there are any numbers contained by both ranges. So, if the end of the first range is the start of the second range or vice versa, then this will return yes.

**is greater**

Takes a first range and a second range. Returns yes if the start of the first range is strictly greater than the end of the second range.

**is greater (point)**

Takes a range and a number. Returns yes if the start of the first range is strictly greater than the number.

**is smaller**

Takes a first range and a second range. Returns yes if the end of the first range is strictly less than the start of the second range.

**is smaller (point)**

Takes a range and a number. Returns yes if the end of the first range is strictly less than the number.

Date type

This type represents a precise moment in time (measured to the nearest millisecond). When displaying dates, we turn them into an easily readable date and time in the user's current time zone; you can use the "formatted as ..." operator to customize how we display it. If a user in one timezone saves a date, and a second user in a different timezone views the saved date, the second user will see it displayed in their local time zone. The user's timezone is the timezone as reported by the user's web browser. Most modern browsers report the timezone; in cases where they don't, we make a best-effort attempt to guess what the timezone is from the user's clock settings. When running a workflow, we use the timezone the user was in when they initiated the workflow. For scheduled and recurring workflows, we remember the timezone from when the user initially scheduled the workflow to run. (So if the user runs workflow A, which schedules workflow B to run two days later, then hops on a plan, and runs workflow C in a new timezone, workflows A and B will run in the same timezone; workflow C will run in a different timezone). In situations where a web browser is not involved, such as triggering a workflow to run via Bubble's API, we use [UTC time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) in our calculations. When doing math with dates, there are two kinds of math: calendar-aware math, where the size of the units of time vary based on things such as the number of days in a month and daylight savings time, and absolute math, where the units you add and subtract have a a fixed number of milliseconds. Most of Bubble's date functions do calendar math. For instance, if a user in the ET timezone in the United States enters the date 'March 11, 2018, 1 am', and uses the '+(days)' operator with a value of 1, they'll see 'March 12, 2018, 1 am' even though, because of daylight savings time, that is actually only 23 hours later, not 24 hours later. Calendar-aware math is always performed relative to the user's current timezone, so it's possible that two users, in two different time zones, could perform the same computation on the same date and get different results. The main exceptions to this rule are the "+(seconds)" and "+(hours)" operators, which perform absolute math: calling them with an argument of 1 always adds exactly one second and 3,600 seconds respectively to the given moment in time. Note that the "change hours to" and "change seconds to" do perform calendar-aware calculations. Absolute math is not impacted by timezones: if two users in different time zones call "+(seconds)" with the same argument on the same date, they will get the exact same moment in time as the result (though that moment in time will be displayed to them in their local timezone if the result is displayed on the screen). When performing calendar-aware math, fractional amounts are rounded to the nearest integer, so adding 0.9 days is the same as adding one day. The exception is adding years, which are rounded to the nearest number of months. When performing absolute math, fractions are rounded to the nearest millisecond, so adding 1.2005 seconds will add 1,201 milliseconds.

**is not in**

Returns false if and only if the value is not present in the argument list.

**:formatted as ...**

Formats the date. Caution: Once a date is formatted, it is considered text and cannot be manipulated as a date.

**<- range ->**

Generates a date range from two dates. This represents a span of time from the moment of the first date to the moment of the second date. Date ranges are a useful tool for representing availabilities or time slots.

**... +(seconds):**

Creates a new date by adding the given number of seconds to the date, or subtracts that number of seconds if it is a negative number. This performs absolute, not calendar-aware math: we always add exactly one-thousand milliseconds per second.

**... +(minutes):**

Creates a new date by adding the given number of minutes to the date, or subtracts that number of minutes if it is a negative number. This performs absolute, not calendar-aware math: we always add exactly 60,000 milliseconds per minute.

**... +(hours):**

Creates a new date by adding the given number of hours to the date, or subtracts that number of hours if it is a negative number. This performs absolute, not calendar-aware math: we always add exactly 3,600,000 milliseconds per hour.

**... +(days):**

Creates a new date by adding the given number of days to the date, or subtracts that number of days if it is a negative number. This performs calendar-aware math in the user's current timezone. For instance, if adding a day crosses the start of daylight savings time in the user's timezone, this function might add 23 hours instead of 24 hours.

**... +(months):**

Creates a new date by adding the given number of month to the date, or subtracts that number of months if it is a negative number. This performs calendar-aware math in the user's current timezone. If the final month doesn't contain a corresponding day because it is shorter than the original month, we use the last day of the month, so adding one day to January 30th yields February 28th (or 29th on leap years).

**... +(years):**

Creates a new date by adding the given number of years to the date, or subtracts that number of years if it is a negative number. This performs calendar-aware math in the user's current timezone.

**... change seconds to ...**

Creates a new date by setting the seconds in the user's current timezone. For example, 'Wed Aug 12 2015 22:21:42' becomes 'Wed Aug 12 2015 22:21:00' with an argument of '0.' Changing to a value greater than 59 will bubble up to minutes. Whenever you call change seconds, we set the milliseconds to 0. This is so that if you set a date to the same seconds, minutes, hours, day, month, and year, it compares equal with another date set to the same values.

**... change minutes to ...**

Creates a new date by setting the minutes in the user's current timezone. For example, 'Wed Aug 12 2015 22:21:42' becomes 'Wed Aug 12 2015 22:55:42' with an argument of '55.' Changing to a value greater than 59 will bubble up to hours.

**... change hours to ...**

Creates a new date by setting the hours in the user's current timezone. For example, 'Wed Aug 12 2015 22:21:42' becomes 'Wed Aug 12 2015 19:21:42' with an argument of '19.' Setting to a value greater than 23 will bubble up to days.

**... change date (day) to ...**

Creates a new date by setting the days in the user's current timezone.. For example, 'Thu Dec 24 2015 13:35:38' becomes 'Sun Dec 6 2015 13:35:38' with an argument of '6.' Setting to a value greater than the number of days in the current month will change to the next month.

**... change month to ...**

Creates a new date by setting the month in the user's current timezone. For example, 'Thu Dec 24 2015 13:35:38' becomes 'Tue Feb 24 2015 13:35:38' with an argument of '2.' The second number is the numeric value for the month, e.g., '1' for January, '2' for February, etc. Setting a value greater than 12 will change to the next year. If the new month has fewer days than the current date, this will change the date to the last day of the new month.

**... change years to ...**

Creates a new date by setting the year in the user's current timezone. For example, 'Wed Aug 12 2015 22:21:42' becomes 'Mon Aug 12 2013 22:21:42' with an argument of '2013.'

**... > ...**

Returns yes if the first date is after the second date.

**... < ...**

Returns yes if the first date is before the second date.

**... - ...**

Subtracts the two dates and returns the difference as a Time difference.

**Extract from date**

Extracts a component from the date, relative to the passed in timezone. Returns the component as a number. Choose from the following options: minute (0 - 59) hour (0 - 23, on the [24-hour clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock)) day (of week: Sun = 0, Mon = 1, ... Sat = 6) date (of month: 1 - 31) week (of year: 1 - 53. We use the [ISO week date system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) for calculating which week it is, which may differ from local conventions) month (1 (Jan) - 12 (Dec)) year (e.g. 2,018) UNIX (in milliseconds: the total number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. This is the same format returned by Javascript's Date.now() function, and it is how dates are tracked behind-the-scenes in Bubble. Note that many computer systems measure unix timestamps in seconds: to convert to seconds, divide this value by 1,000.

**Rounded down**

Round down a date to a given component, relative to the user's current time zone. Returns the rounded date. See 'Extract from date' for options.

**Equals rounded down**

Returns yes if, when rounding both dates to the given component, the results are identical. See 'Rounded down' for more details.

**... <- max -> ...**

Returns the later of the two dates.

**... <- min -> ...**

Returns the earlier of the two dates.

Date range type

This type is composed of two dates. The range is the time in between. Use this to build scheduling, booking systems, etc.

**is in**

Returns true if the value is present in the argument list.

**is not in**

Returns true if the value is not present in the argument list.

**:start**

Returns the start of the range, the smallest value.

**:end**

Returns the end of the range, the largest value.

**:center**

Returns the center of the range by averaging the start and end.

**contains range**

Takes a first range and a second range. Returns yes if the first range contains the second range. "Contains" means that the start of the second range is greater than or equal to the start of the first range, and the end of the second range is less than or equal to the end of the first range. So, if the two ranges are the same, then this will return yes.

**contains**

Takes a range and a single date. Returns yes if the date is contained by the range. It is contained if it is greater than or equal to the start of the range and less than or equal to the end of the range.

**is contained by**

Takes a first range and a second range. Returns yes if the first range is contained by the second range. "Contains" means that the start of the first range is greater than or equal to the start of the second range, and the end of the first range is less than or equal to the end of the second range. So, if the two ranges are the same, then this will return yes.

**overlaps with**

Takes a first range and a second range. Returns yes if there are any dates contained by both ranges. So, if the end of the first range is the start of the second range or vice versa, then this will return yes.

**is after**

Takes a first range and a second range. Returns yes if the start of the first range is strictly greater than the end of the second range.

**is after (point)**

Takes a range and a date. Returns yes if the start of the first range is strictly greater than the date.

**is before**

Takes a first range and a second range. Returns yes if the end of the first range is strictly less than the start of the second range.

**is before (point)**

Takes a range and a date. Returns yes if the end of the first range is strictly less than the date.

Date interval type

This type represents a difference between two dates. It represents a precise number of milliseconds, rather than a calendar-friendly quantity such as "one day". Adding and subtracting Date intervals always performs absolute math, not calendar-aware math. See the Date type above for more information on the difference between calendar-aware math and absolute math.

**is in**

Returns true if the value is present in the argument list.

**is not in**

Returns true if the value is not present in the argument list.

**:format as days**

Formats the difference as a number of days. We calculate this by dividing by 24 hours, then rounding to the nearest tenth (so 298944000 milliseconds becomes 3.5 days).

**:format as hours**

Formats the difference as a number of hours. We calculate this by dividing by one hour (i.e. 3,600,000 milliseconds) and rounding to the nearest tenth.

**:format as minutes**

Formats the difference as a number of minutes. We divide through by 60,000 milliseconds and round to the nearest whole number.

**:format as seconds**

Formats the difference as a number of seconds. We divide through by 1,000 milliseconds and round to the nearest whole number.

Boolean type

Watch out!

With a yes/no field, there is a difference between "no value" and "no"! If you have a mix of the two, keep in mind that this distinction might show up, for example, when you sort Things by this field.

**is in**

Returns true if the value is present in the argument list.

**is not in**

Returns true if the value is not present in the argument list.

**is "yes"**

Returns yes if the boolean value is true.

**is "no"**

Returns no if the boolean value is false.

**... and ....**

Returns the logic AND of two yes/no values. Returns yes if both values are yes.

**... or ....**

Returns the logic OR of two yes/no values. Returns yes if either of the two values is yes.

**...:formatted as text**

Formats the result of the yes/no differently. Use this function to change the language of 'yes' and 'no.'

**...:formatted as number**

Formats the result of the yes/no as a number to use in a calculation. A standard use case is '1' for yes and '0' for no, but you can use any numbers.

File type

This represents a file, i.e., the link of a file uploaded to the server.

**is in**

Returns true if the value is present in the argument list.

**is not in**

Returns true if the value is not present in the argument list.

**...'s file name**

Extracts the file name from a link. For example, '[//s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/id/filename.pdf](//s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/id/filename.pdf)' returns 'filename.pdf.'

**...'s URL**

Returns the link of the file.

**:saved to S3**

When saving a file, the link that represents it on the web is saved. If it comes from an external API, it may be hosted elsewhere. To save it to Bubble's server, to use Imgix on for instance, use this option. This occurs only in workflows that save things.

The maximum file size on the :saved to S3 operator is 50 MB.

If a file is added using this operator, but the file already exists in S3, the original link will be saved. A new version will not be uploaded.

**Tip:** If you click into this operator, you may also see the option for "New file name." This feature allows you to rename files before they are uploaded. It's for the case where you are generating a file, say from an external API, and then saving it to your Bubble app. This option to rename the file as a part of the workflow would be the way to do it. If the file you are looking to rename has already been saved to S3, this will not update the name.

**:encoded in base64**

This fetches the contents of the file and encodes it using base64, which is a common standard used for passing file data. Use this for uploading files to certain APIs that require data in base64 form. Note: At the moment, this operator only works in server-side workflows. Running it in the web browser returns nothing.

**Note:** Private files in base64 cannot be decoded through API workflows and the API Connector, as these functions rely on the file to be publicly downloadable.

Image type

This represents an image, i.e., the link of an image uploaded to the server.

**is not in**

Returns false if and only if the value is not present in the argument list.

**...'s file name**

Extracts the file name from a link. For example, '[//s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/id/picture.png](//s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/id/picture.png)' returns 'picture.png.'

**...'s URL**

Returns the link of the image.

**:saved to S3**

When saving a file, the link that represents it on the web is saved. If it comes from an external API, it may be hosted elsewhere. To save it to Bubble's server, to use Imgix on for instance, use this option. This occurs only in workflows that save things.

**:encoded in base64**

This fetches the contents of the file and encodes it using base64, which is a common standard used for passing file data. Use this for uploading files to certain APIs that require data in base64 form. Note: At the moment, this operator only works in server-side workflows. Running it in the web browser returns nothing.

**:processed with Imgix**

Processes the image with Imgix. For example, automatically crop the picture to keep the face, enhance it, reduce red eyes, apply sepia effects, etc. See the [Imgix documentation](https://docs.imgix.com/apis/url) for more details. Note: Only images hosted on Bubble's server can use this feature.

Known Issue

In rare situations, processing an app with Imgix will actually result in a larger file than the original image. If this is happening to you and undesirable, you can add &ignore_imgix to the end of the image's URL to disable Imgix.

Geographic Address

This represents an address.

**is in**

Returns true if the value is present in the argument list.

**is not in**

Returns true if the value is not present in the argument list.

**...'s formatted address**

This returns a text version of the address, which can be printed in a standard way. Caution: Once an address is formatted, it is considered text and cannot be manipulated as an address.

**...'s link to Google Maps**

Returns a link that, when clicked, opens a Google Map window and centers the marker on the position of the current address.

**... distance from ...**

Returns the distance between the two addresses, either in the metric or US system.

**:extract ...**

Extracts particular data from an address, like the country, state, street, etc.

**...'s latitude**

This returns the latitude of the address as a number.

**...'s longitude**

This returns the longitude of the address as a number.

**...'s time zone ID**

This returns the time zone of an address as a string, following the standard encoding returned by Google. See [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) for more information.

**...'s time zone name**

Returns the name of the time zone of an address, such as 'Eastern Daylight Time.' This is **not** what you should use for time zone formatting. Use the ID instead.

**...'s daylight saving time offset**

The offset for daylight saving time in seconds. This will be zero if the time zone is not in daylight saving time at the current time.

**...'s offset from UTC (minutes)**

This is the offset from UTC (in minutes) for the given location. This does not take into effect daylight savings.

List of things

It is common to deal with lists of texts, numbers, things, users, etc. This manipulates these lists. Currently, lists are limited to 10,000 items. Trying to add additional items will result in an error message.

**... :count**

[](https://youtu.be/Wma-IKUWH44)

Our Academy quick tip on how to use :count

Returns the number of items in the list.

**... contains ...**

Returns yes if the list contains the argument.

**... doesn't contains ...**

Returns yes if the list does not contain the argument.

**...:first item**

[](https://youtu.be/AT3dHkRz-Zk)

Watch our Academy quick tip on how to retrieve the first item of a list

Returns the first item of the list.

**...:last item**

Returns the last item of the list.

**...:random item**

Returns any single item from the list. This is mostly for display purposes, because the return may not be mathematically random.

**...:item**

Returns theth item of the list.

**...:items until**

Returns a sublist of the list, from the first item to theth item.

**...:items from**

Returns a sublist of the list, from theth item to the end.

**... contains list ...**

Returns yes if the first list contains all the entries from the second list.

**... join with ...**

Returns a text version of the list, using the argument as the separator between the items. Using a 'line_break' separator will make each entry be on a new line.

**... :sum**

Sums the elements in a list of numbers by adding them together. For instance, the sum of the list [2, 4, 7] is 13. Empty entries are ignored. The sum of an empty list is the "empty" value.

**... :product**

Multiplies the elements in a list of numbers together. For instance, the product of the list [2, 4, 7] is 56. Empty entries are ignored. The product of an empty list is the "empty" value.

**... :average**

Computes the arithmetic average of the elements in a list of numbers, by adding them together and then dividing by the number of entries. For instance, the average of the list [2, 4, 7] is 6.5. Empty entries are ignored, which means that the average of a list of numbers might not exactly equal the sum of the list divided by the count. The average of an empty list is the "empty" value.

**... :median**

Computes the median element of the elements in a list of numbers. Empty entries are ignored, and don't count towards the determination of what the median element is. For lists with an even number of elements, the median is the arithmetic average of the middle two elements. For instance, the median of the list [2, 4, 7] is 4, and the median of the list [2, 4, 7, 8] is 5.5. The median of an empty list is the "empty" value.

**... :min**

Returns the smallest of the elements in a list of numbers. A large negative number counts as being very small for the purpose of min, so the min of the list [-100, -5, 0, 1] is -100. Empty entries are ignored, and the min of an empty list is the "empty" value.

**... :max**

Returns the largest of the elements in a list of numbers. The max of the list [-100, 2, 4, 7] is 7. Empty entries are ignored, and the max of an empty list is the "empty" value.

**... :approximate count**

Returns an approximate count of the number of items in a list. This is a performance optimizing operator that trades accuracy for a speed increase. It will be faster to return results than the :count operator, but it will be, as the name suggests, an approximation of the count (we estimate it to be within 2% of the actual count for most use cases).

**... :cached aggregation**

Allows you to reuse recently computed aggregation results across page views instead of recalculating a value every time it is requested from the server. The server will store the result of the specified aggregation for 30 seconds, during which it will return that already calculated result for all identical requests instead of computing a new value. Note that the lifetime of the cached value is not extended upon subsequent requests, so the value will always be recomputed when requested again after the initial 30 seconds. Allowed aggregation operators are “count”, “approximate count”, “max”, “min”, “median”, “average”, “sum”, and “product”, though some of these are only available on certain underlying list types.

**...:filtered**

Filters a list of things with a criteria. It's similar to a search but happens after the search and can also be used on a field that is a list of things. The filtering constraints work similarly to a search constraint.

**Tip:** Use operators such as "and" to indicate that an item in the list should meet all specified criteria, or ":join with" to define a list where an item can meet one of a list of criteria.

**...:format as text**

Formats a list of things to display its content. You can choose a delimiter for your list, and the content to show per list item. All items will share the format that you specify. For example, if you have a list of names, you can choose to display “This name” in bold with a space delimiter. This will show all the names in bold separated by a space: **name1 name2 name3**. This is also useful for sending emails to your users. In the body of your email, you might format a list of Events to display start times for upcoming events. You can also add bb code to customize its appearance. For example, if you specify your content to show as “[li][b]This date[/b][/li]” and your delimiter as a line break, you can create a bolded list with bullets:

- **January 1, 2021 1:00 pm**
- **January 2, 2021 2:00 pm**

If you need to format text as a JSON to send to an external API, you may also use this operator. You can create

`{ key: “value” } formatting for as many of the values as there are in your database. For example, you might pass a list as: { key: “This value’s field” } Then if your list contained two items, the result could look like: { key: “Value1's field” }, { key: “Value2's field” }`

**...:sorted**

Sorts a list of things.

**:ranked by...**

Ranks a list of things by average RMS similarity of all numerical fields to a target item of the same type. Use this to match people for a dating app for instance.

**... merged with ...**

This operation merges two lists of things. It returns a new list with entries from both lists. If an entry is in both, it will only appear once in the returned list.

**... intersect with ...**

This operation takes two lists of things and returns the entries that are in both lists.

**... :unique elements**

[](https://youtu.be/U5rdKEZuPvQ)

Watch this video to learn more about the Unique Elements Operator

This operation removes all double items from the list.

**...:plus item**

This operation adds an item to a list of things. It returns a new list with the original list plus the new item. If the new item is already in the list, it will not be added.

**...:minus item**

This operation removes an item to a list of things. It returns a new list with the original list minus the item. If the new item is not in the list, it will not be removed.

**...:minus list**

Returns the original list minus any elements that are present in the argument list.

**...:make static**

This operation converts a list that relies on dynamic data, e.g., input's values in search constraints, and converts it into a list with the current items. Once converted to static, the list will not change if underlying values change. Note that this works only within the context of workflows; it will not change the behavior of repeating groups. Caution: This is an advanced feature.

**..:group by**

Groups the list into chunks of related entries, and computes summaries of each group. This is useful for visualizing your data in a chart or table: for instance, you could create a table showing the number and dollar values of orders by customer, or the number of new users to your application by month. Selecting ":group by" will open a panel with the option to add groupings and add aggregations. In the sentence, "Show the total X grouped by Y", X is an aggregation and Y is a grouping. For each grouping you add, you'll see "Field 1 to group by", "Field 2 group by", and so on. This is the field of the list item used to pick which group to put in. Currently we support grouping on users and custom data types, text fields, numbers, and dates. For many uses, adding a single grouping is sufficient. Adding multiple groupings allows grouping items by two fields. For example, suppose you have a list of orders, each with a customer and a date. You might want to see a chart showing orders grouped by customer and month, in which case you could add both fields as groupings. The order of the groupings determines the order of the list results: we first sort by the first grouping, and then by the second. For instance, if you group by customer, and then month, you might see an output list with {Customer 1, Jan}, {Customer 1, Feb}, {Customer 1, Mar}, {Customer 2, Jan}, {Customer 2, Feb}, {Customer 2, Mar}. Whereas if your first grouping was month, followed by customer, the results would be {Jan, Customer 1}, {Jan, Customer 2}, {Feb, Customer 1}, {Feb, Customer 2}, {Mar, Customer 1}, {Mar, Customer 2}. When you select a number field to group on, you will see additional options. A "Type of grouping" dropdown will let you pick between "Exact" and "Bucket". If you pick exact, grouping by numbers will work the same as grouping by text or by a custom type: list entries with the exact same value for that field will be put in the same group. So all entries with the value 3.1 will be grouped together, and all entries with the value 9.2 will be in a different group. In contrast, if you pick "Bucket", you can group similar numbers into buckets. You'll be prompted to pick an "Interval" and "Starting value", which determines how the bucketing works. The first bucket is the starting value, and then they increase by the interval, so for example, if you pick a starting value of 10, and an interval of 5, your buckets will be 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and so on. List entries are placed in the largest bucket that they are equal to or greater than: so, 15 goes in bucket 15, as does 19.999, but 20 goes in bucket 20. Entries below the starting value, such as 9 in this example, are left out of the final results. If a "Bucket" grouping on a number field is the last grouping in your list of groupings (or if it is the only grouping), you will also see the checkbox "Do not skip empty groups". If you check it, you will be prompted to enter an "Ending value". This option allows you to specify a continuous range of buckets to display, regardless of whether you actually have data for every bucket in that range. It is most useful in combination with a chart element, to construct a graph that doesn't skip things that you do not have values for. So for instance, if your start value is 20, and your interval is 10, and your end value is 50, the buckets you will get are 20, 30, 40, and 50, even if you don't have any data between 30 and 40. (If your end value doesn't exactly match a bucket, the final bucket will be the one that the end value would fall into: so if your end is 58 in this example, the final bucket would still be 50). Items after the final bucket will be left out (so 61 would not be included). If you use the "Do not skip empty groups" option with multiple groupings, we compute the entire range of buckets for each preceding grouping. So for instance, if you first group by a text field that contains the names of fruits, and then group by a bucketed number from from 20 to 50 as in our above example, you might see groupings that look like the following: {apple, 20}, {apple, 30}, {apple, 40}, {apple, 50}, {banana, 20}, {banana, 30}, {banana, 40}, {banana, 50}, {pear, 20}, {pear, 30}, {pear, 40}, {pear, 50}. You will see all twelve of these groupings as long as you have at least one apple, at least one banana, and at least one pear with a number between 20 and 60. Grouping on date fields is very similar to grouping on number fields. There is an "Exact" option that groups list entries with the exact same date together. Note that, because dates represent moments in time accurate to a millisecond, two entries might look like they have the same date, but actually be half a second apart from each other: in that case, they would end up in different groups. In addition to the "Exact" option, there are also "Day" and "Month" options. These work similarly to the "Bucket" option for numbers, but they compute the beginning and the ends of buckets using calendar-aware math in the user's current time zone in order to group dates that share the same calendar day or calendar month. It's easiest to illustrate with an example. Suppose you are in New York, you group by "Day", with "Interval" set to 2, and set the "Starting date" to be 11:03 am, April 17, 2018 ET. The first bucket will be the beginning of the starting date in the current timezone: so in this case, midnight, April 17, 2018 ET. The second bucket will be two days later in the current timezone (because you picked an interval of 2): midnight, April 19, 2018 ET. Adding the interval uses the same logic as the [\+(days)](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/operations-and-comparisondays) operator. Like with the "Bucket" option on number fields, entries are placed in the bucket that they are greater than or equal to, so 11:59 pm April 18 would go in the midnight April 17 bucket, but midnight April 19 would go in the midnight April 19 bucket. The "Month" option works the same as the day option, but the starting value is rounded down to the beginning of the month, so a starting value of 11:03 am, April 17, 2018 ET would become midnight, April 1, 2018 ET if the user is in the ET timezone. Subsequent buckets are calculated by adding the interval value using the same logic as the [\+(months)](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/operations-and-comparisonmonths) operator. If the final grouping is a "Day" or "Month" grouping, there will be a "Do not skip empty groups" option. This works exactly the same way as it does for number "Bucket" groupings, described above, and is useful if you want to display data as a time series: a chart showing a line graph of user signups by month would look strange if it skipped months where no one signed up instead of showing 0. As with "Bucket" groupings, the ending date indicates the final bucket. So, if you are grouping by month, interval 1, and your ending date is a moment in June 17, 2018, your final bucket will be midnight, June 1, 2018. This bucket will include any data point that falls in June, including ones after the 17th! If you want to make sure that data for June 19 does not show up in your groupings, you need to filter those items out of the list prior to calling ":group by" on it. Whereas groupings determine how the entries in the original list are grouped together, aggregations determine what we calculate for each grouping. The simplest aggregation is "Count", which just counts the number of items that were placed into each group. The other aggregations all perform mathematical operations on a number field: if you select one of them, you will be prompted to choose a field to calculate on. These aggregations all work the same as their equivalently-named operator on a list of numbers: [Sum](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/operations-and-comparisonsum), [Product](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/operations-and-comparisonproduct), [Average](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/operations-and-comparisonaverage-1), [Median](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/operations-and-comparisonmedian), [Min](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/operations-and-comparisonmin-1), and [Max](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/operations-and-comparisonmax-1). The output of doing a ":group by" operation on a list is a new list. You can feed this list to a repeating group or chart, or do further list transformations on it. The list contains one item for each group generated, and each item has one field for each grouping and one field for each aggregation. The field name for each grouping will have the same name of the field that was grouped on, and will contain the bucket value for that group. So for instance, if you do a "Bucket" grouping on a number field called "my magic number", grouped by interval 10 starting from 0, the output list will will have a field called "my magic number". The grouping that represents all entries that fell in bucket 20–in other words, had a magic number greater than or equal to 20, but less than 30 -- will have that field set to 20. Each aggregation you add to the grouping generates a field in the result list named after both the aggregation function and the number field it was calculated on. So for example, if you added an aggregation that computed the average of "my magic number", you would see a field called "average of my magic number" in the output list. The "Count" aggregation, since it does not operate on a specific field but rather just counts the number of entries in the grouping, simply adds a field named "count" to the output.

**Note:** The Group by operator prioritizes performance. As a result, Groupings do not include much information about each individual item contained within them. While work is in progress to address this limitation, in the mean time, a grouped dataset will not automatically update if any item within that dataset is created, updated, or destroyed.

...:each item...

The `:each item` prefix is added to a List operator when the operator acts on an item in the List rather than the List itself. This prefix does not change any functionality, it is merely there to clarify the intended behavior of the selected operator.

Custom Types

These types of data are the types defined when you created your data structure. Most of these operations also apply to the user type.

**Creator**

This returns the user who created the current thing. If the user was not logged in when the thing was created, it will be empty.

**Created Date**

This returns the date of the creation of the thing. Its type is date and can be manipulated as a date.

**Modified Date**

This returns the date of the last modification of the thing. Its type is date and can be manipulated as a date.

**Slug [Beta]**

This returns the slug value of the thing selected. This slug is unique for each thing of a certain type and its value is displayed in URLs when a page is associated to this thing.

**...'s unique id**

This returns the unique id of the thing in the Bubble application database. Each entry has a unique id. Use this to generate links, etc. Caution: This is an advanced feature that is not normally necessary.

**...'s link**

This feature generates a link to a page of the app whose type of content is the type of the current thing. Clicking that link will open that page with that thing as the current page's thing.

**...:converted to list**

This feature converts a unique item into a list when you need to work with other lists or a repeating group.

Custom Fields

Create new fields for the custom types defined in the app. In the Workflow Tab, 'Create a new thing' action, then select 'Create a new field' in the dropdown menu. This is the same as adding a new field in the Data Tab.

[](https://youtu.be/4txlG9nwr1E)

Our Academy quick tip on adding data types as custom fields

**Field name**

Enter a name to describe the field.

**Field type**

A field must have a type. It can be a number, text, yes/no, address, etc. It can also be a custom type already created to store a composite object. For example, an apartment will have a field of type booking, which is also defined as a custom type.

**This field is a list (multiple entries)**

It is common to deal with lists of texts, numbers, things, users, etc. Checking this box defines a field as a list of things. Currently, lists are limited to 10,000 items. Trying to add additional items will result in an error message.

**Default value**

The default value is a way to define what the field should be if there is no information in the 'Create new thing' action for the current field.

User Type

These are the specific fields and options to use for the type user.

**Email**

This applies to the type user only and returns the user's email. If the user used a social network to sign up, it will return the email provided to that social network, if available.

**...is logged in**

Returns yes when the current user is logged in.

...has an account

Returns yes when the user has an account. This option is shown when the data source is not the current user.

**...isn't logged in**

Returns yes when the current user isn't logged in.

...doesn't have an account

Returns yes when the user doesn’t have an account. This option is shown when the data source is not the current user.

**...'s email confirmed**

Returns yes if the current user confirmed their email by clicking on the link in the confirmation email.

**... uses password**

Returns yes if the current user used a password to create an account, and not an OAuth provider.

**... uses 2FA**

Returns yes if the current user has activated 2-factor authentication on his account.

**... has 2FA backup codes**

Returns yes if the current user has set up some backup codes on his account.

**... is using cookies**

This operator is only visible for applications that have enabled the ["Do not set cookies on new visitors by default"](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/application-settings/generado-not-set-cookies-on-new-visitors-by-default) setting. Returns yes if the user has cookies set via the opt-in to cookies action or via signing up or logging in, and no if we are not setting cookies on the user.

Option Sets

Option sets define a static list of choices for use in dropdowns, etc.. Options inside the sets have at least a text display, but they can have additional attributes defined in the Data tab.

**...'s Display**

This gets the text value of the option for use in displaying in things like dropdowns and text fields.

**...:defaulting to**

This feature sets an option to a default value, if the selected option is missing.

**...:converted to list**

This feature converts a single option into a list.

Option Attributes

Create new attributes for the option sets defined in the app. Attributes define additional values attached to your options in a set. You can add attributes in the Data tab.

**Attribute name**

Enter a name to describe the attribute.

**Attribute type**

An attribute must have a type. It can be a number, text, yes/no, address, etc. It can also be another Option set.

**This attribute is a list (multiple entries)**

It is common to deal with lists of texts, numbers, things, users, etc. Checking this box defines a attributes as a list of things. Currently, lists are limited to 10,000 items. Trying to add additional items will result in an error message.

Options

Create new options for the option sets defined in the app. An option set can have many different options in it, each with a display text (as well as any additional attributes you want). You can add options in the Data tab.

**Option name**

Enter a name to describe the option. This will be the new option's "Display" attribute.

 Search

This is the short-form **technical reference** entry describing how to search for data in Bubble. If you are looking for more in-depth and long-form articles on the subject, you may be interested in checking our [Finding data](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/finding-data) article or our series on [data in Bubble](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data).

These are the search options and operators to use when performing searches.

Ignore empty constraints

[](https://youtu.be/6VEavvd4TG4)

Our Academy quick tip on how to ignore empty constraints

If this checkbox is checked, constraints using values evaluating to null will be ignored. In other words, if a constraint evaluates to null, all items will be returned. If this box is not checked, the search will only return items whose field's value is actually null. Note that this does not apply to the Advanced filter.

Type of find

Select the type of things you looking for. It should be user or a type defined by you.

Constraints

[](https://youtu.be/gOjGDCJrXYI)

Watch our Academy quick tip on how to use search constraints

Enter the different constraints to apply to this search.

Text matching in the database is limited to the first 256 characters for indexing purposes. If you need to match text longer than 256 characters in a search, consider appending a "[filtered:](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/operations-and-comparisonfiltered)" with an advanced constraint, saying "'s = ". The reason you have to do an advanced filter is that it forces the expression to load all the items out of the database and do the full string match, rather than just the first 256 characters.

Sorting field

Choose the field to sort the list.

**Note:** Re-sorting a repeating group will immediately change all "current cell" values in any display elements that were dynamically derived from the current cell. Specifically, if you have a popup that opened to display "Current Cell's Thing's Info", this information is linked to the cell's index; the Thing will change when the repeating group is resorted. If there are visible elements that rely on "current cell's thing" as a data source, these will be updated once the group is re-sorted. This can result in changes in elements such as popups, group focus, or reusable elements that conditionally display information about the current cell.

**Change which field......**

[](https://youtu.be/n4yBRxHAPgk)

Watch our Academy quick tip to learn how to sort a list

Select this option if you want the sorting field to be dynamic. When selected, another field will display and allow you to define the field. It can be dynamic and should match the name of an existing field. If it does not match, the application will show an error.

**Random sorting**

Choose this option to randomize the order results. It will be different for each user and after each refresh. It will be the same when re-running a workflow without refreshing the page.

Dynamic field name

If you want the search to be sorted according to a field chosen by the user, define an expression to define which field the search should use. For instance, the expression you design here should evaluate to 'Created Date' or some other fields you have defined in your type (it should match the displayed name of the field).

Distance from

When sorting on a location field, results will be sorted by distance relative to a point. This field defines which point. Current position, an address, etc.

Descending

Choose 'yes' to sort in descending order or 'no' to sort in ascending order. This option can be dynamic and defines an expression that returns a yes/no, e.g., a checkbox element.

Adding additional sorting rules

When you need more than one sorting rule, click this button and select a field and a descending/ascending order for that field. The rules will be applied in the order listed.

Any field

Performs a search across all the fields of the application database for a given type. For example, search for all entries with John as a first OR last name.

Advanced

Performs more advanced searches. For example, to find all apartments whose creators have an email hosted by [yahoo.com](http://yahoo.com), use 'This apartment's creator's email:extract domain is '[yahoo.com](http://yahoo.com).' This operation happens after the search or list is retrieved from the server and is not as efficient as using constraints on a search.

 Privacy

​

This is the short-form **technical reference** entry describing Privacy Rules. If you are looking for more in-depth and long-form articles on how it works, you may be interested in checking the Bubble manual [Privacy Rule article](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/data/the-database/protecting-data-with-privacy-rules).

This section of the Data Tab provides security by allowing you to define rules to prevent users from seeing or modifying data they should not have access to. To do this, define rules for each of your custom types, if needed. When multiple rules apply, the user has access to an object if any one rule grants access to it.

This is a **very important feature** for your app's data security! Without Privacy Rules on your data types, a savvy outsider can access all the data in your app, even if you don't design a page that shows that data.

Setting up privacy rules is definitely an important best practice when Bubbling.

Define a new rule

This button creates a new rule for the selected type. Name the type with an explicit name and define conditions and permissions. The condition defines which users this rule applies to, while the permissions define what they can do with the data if they meet the conditions.

Name

Name the rule. Modify the name in this input.

Delete

Clicking this icon deletes the rule. This action does not delete data. It only removes the rule for the selected type.

When (condition)

Define the conditions that check whether a given user is part of the rule or not. Create a dynamic expression with the Composer, building it piece by piece. For example, if you define the condition for the type 'Event' as 'This event's creator is current user,' then only the user who created the thing of type 'event' will be part of that rule.

Permissions

This defines what users in that current rule can do with the data.

**Find this in searches**

Uncheck this box to prevent users who are in this rule to see the search results for this type.

**View all fields**

Check this box for these users to be able to see all the fields of a thing of the current type, provided they meet the conditions. If you uncheck this box, you will be able to select which fields are viewable by users in this rule.

**View attached files**

If this box is unchecked, users will not be able to see the uploaded files attached to a thing of this type. For example, let's say you set up a workflow where users can create an 'Apartment,' and that apartment has pictures. Set up the picture uploader in a way that links the picture to the actual apartment in the database. Then, if you uncheck this box and if the condition is 'This apartment's creator isn't current user,' other users will not be able to see that picture, even if an image displays it or if a user has a link to the image file.

**Allow auto-binding**

Bind the content of an input to a field of a thing. When the user modifies the content of the input, the thing gets updated automatically. See [Enable auto-binding on parent element's thing](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/input-formElements.GeneralInput.auto_binding) for input elements. You need to enable users to modify fields through a permission. Use 'Allow auto-binding.' Check this box to allow users to do this if they meet a condition. Once checked, choose from the different fields that can be modified through auto-binding.

**Modify via API**

When the Data API is enabled for this type, this permission grants the user the right to modify any of the fields of this thing. For the modification to be allowed, the rule that governs this permission must be true both before and after the modification. This lets you restrict which fields may be modified. If you need more granular field restrictions, instead of granting this permission, use the Workflow API, which lets you control exactly what gets changed.

**Delete via API**

When the Data API is enabled for this type, this permission grants the user the right to delete this thing via the API.

**Create via API**

When the Data API is enabled for this type, this permission grants the user the right to create new things via the API. If the rule that grants this permission references fields on the thing, attempts to create a thing where the rule does not apply will be rejected.

Note: Modifying data in the middle of a workflow

If you have an element that displays data only to certain users, that data could be briefly displayed to a user that does not have permissions if this user triggers a workflow that you as a developer have defined to modify that piece of private data and if the modification does not need to come from the server or a remote source such as an external API.

Fortunately, we have a feature for this use case. See [Scheduled Workflows](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/api-workflows/scheduling-api-workflows).

 Styles

Element type

Select a type from the dropdown, such as Alert, Group, or Repeating Group, to return the existing styles for that element.

Search by name

Type the name of an existing style, such as "Standard Alert," to find and edit that style.

Apply theme

Add a visual identity to your application. Choose from Standard, Dark Theme, Twitter Bootstrap, Material Design, TODC Bootstrap, or Dark, Flat, or Rounded UI. Choosing one of these themes will overwrite your app's predefined styles with different colors and angles.

Add style

Add a custom style to your application. Choose a name and element type, such as "Custom Alert" for "Alerts." Once you define this style's properties, you can apply this style throughout your app in that element's property editor.

Find all elements using this style

Access a shortcut to the App Search Tool, which will return a list of any elements currently using this style. Clicking on a result in the App Search Tool will take you to the location of that styled element in your application.

Make this style the default

Any new elements of this type will automatically be created with this style, rather than the predefined styles that come with your application.

Remove this style as the default

Any new elements of this type will no longer be created with this style. Unless you set another default for this element type, new elements will not have a style when created.

​

Sending data

Frequently, you want to send data/parameters with the calls. They can either be in the URL in a stringified, URL-encoded way, usually for GET, or in the body of the request, usually for POST. When you send data with a request, Bubble validates it and makes sure it has the correct format. Here are four particular cases: 1) **Geographic addresses:** This data should be sent as a string '33 Nassau Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11222,' and Bubble will use the Google Map API to encode it as an address with a latitude and longitude. You can also send them as an object. `{ address: String lat: Number lng: Number }` where latitude and longitude **or** address is mandatory. 2) **Dates:** Send a date as a string or timestamp. For example, 'Wed Jan 13 2016,' '01/13/2016,' 'Wed Jan 13 2016 16:45:09 GMT-0500 (EST),' or '1453398788637.' 3) **Files and Images:** When a parameter is a file or image, you have two ways to define the content in the request. You can submit a string, which should be the URL of the file/image hosted on a storage service, or you can provide the raw data and the API call will upload the content to Bubble's hosting services. In the later case, the value provided should be a JSON object as follows: `{ filename: String contents: Base64-encoded binary data private: Boolean attach_to: String }` where: – `filename` is the file name. Optional, but recommended to get the file type. – `contents` is the base64-encoded binary data of the file. Required. – `private` is a boolean, true/false, that defines whether the file is protected and attached to an object in the database. Optional. – `attach_to` is the unique ID of who/which thing owns the file. Required if private is true. If there is an ambiguity in processing the data sent, Bubble returns a 400 error, 'INVALID_DATA.' 4) **Things:** If a parameter is a thing, e.g., an entry in the application database, or a list of things, you can send it using the ID of the thing. When such a request is made, the API will retrieve the thing with that ID and validate the type. It should be the type defined at the parameter level for a workflow, for instance. If a thing isn't found or not of the right type, Bubble returns a 400 error, 'INVALID_DATA'.

Bubble API response

Bubble's API generates data in the JSON format. If you use the Workflow API, the *Return data from API* action permits specification of the data returned by the call. You will find a more detailed description of API response in our [Data API request](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-data-api/data-api-requests) and [Returning data fro the workflow API request](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api/api-workflows/creating-api-workflowreturning-data-from-the-api-workflow) articles.

Returning a login token

Using a *Sign up* or *Log the user in* action in your workflow generates a response that includes a user_id, token, and expires value. These facilitate the authentication of ensuing calls as the user who has just registered or logged in.

Success and error codes

A 200 code, potentially accompanied by some data, signifies the success of calls, whereas unsuccessful calls produce an error code.

Rate limiting

Requests are rate-limited by default to 1,000 requests/minute per application, collectively between Live and Development. A rate-limited request will return an HTTP 429 error.

API Versions

A new version is introduced when a non backward compatible change is deployed. The current API version of 1.1 was introduced on January 19, 2017. – **Version 1.1:** Values are returned as Javascript objects when possible in API responses. In particular, dates are returned as `2016-11-11T19:14:46.517Z` instead of a timestamp, and geographic addresses are returned as a JSON object. Introduced on January 19, 2017. `location = { address: "Les Ferreys, 14130, France" lat: 49.19959 lng: 0.19707 }` – **Version 1.0:** The first release. Introduced in January 2016. You can send values for addresses either as an address string or object, which should be similar to the output format. When submitting, only lat/lng or an address is required.

----
 The Data API

The Data API allows other systems to search for, read, create, modify and delete data in your application’s database via a RESTful interface.

Enabling the Data API

The Data API is disabled by default. To enable it, go to Settings - API and check the box 'This app exposes a Data API'. This allows you to select one-by-one which data types are exposed in the Data API.

The Data API and privacy rules

Access to data is controlled by the privacy rules applied to that particular data type.

View all fields

If this box is checked, the client will be able to retrieve all the fields on all the things of a given data type. If you uncheck this box you can check which fields are returned one-by-one.

Find this in searches

If this box is checked, the client will be able to retrieve a list of things of a given data type, optionally using search constraints.

View attached files

If this box is checked, the client will be able to retrieve files saved to a given data type.

Allow auto-binding

This setting does not affect clients who access the database via the Data API.

Data API Privacy Rules

Whenever the Data API is enabled for a database thing, three new options are available in that thing’s privacy rule:

- Create via API
- Modify via API
- Delete via API

These settings only apply to clients that access the database via the Data API. All three are disabled by default on existing privacy rules. They do not affect your application’s regular users or your API Workflows.

 Authentication

This reference entry covers how to authenticate with the Bubble Data API

This is the short-form **technical reference** entry of the Bubble API authentication methods. If you are looking for more in-depth and long-form articles on how the Bubble API works, you may be interested in checking the [Bubble API manual](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-bubble-api/the-data-api/authenticatiomanual-entries).

Authenticating as an admin

Using an API Token gives a client full administrator access to your database. This means that privacy rules are ignored and the client gets the same access level that an admin gets in the Bubble editor.

To generate an API token go to Settings - API and click the ‘Generate a new API token’ button. This will generate a 32-character token consisting of a combination of numbers and letters. To use the token in an API request, include it in the Authorization header of the request as a bearer token:

Authorization: Bearer

**API Token Label**

The API Token Label field lets you give each API Token a descriptive name. The label is visible only in the Bubble editor and does not affect the Data API in any way.

**Private Key**

This is the 32-character token used by the client to authenticate.

**Regenerate private key**

Clicking this button will generate a new API token using the same label. Note that the new token will replace the old one. If you want to create an additional new token, use the ‘Generate a new API token’ button instead.

Authenticating as a User

Authenticating as a User gives a client access to your database with the same privileges as that User has, as defined in the privacy rules.

To authenticate as a User, set up an API Workflow with a ‘Log the User in’ action. Bubble will return a token in the JSON that can be used for subsequent calls.

----
 Data API endpoints

This section describes how to identify the correct endpoints when using the Data API

You can find the API endpoint for your application in Settings - API.

Data API Root URL

The root URL of your application is structured as follows:

[https://appname.bubbleapps.io/api/1.1/obj/typename](https://appname.bubbleapps.io/api/1.1/obj/typename)

or if you have registered a domain:

[https://yourdomain.com/api/1.1/obj/typename](https://yourdomain.com/api/1.1/obj/typename)

Where the following variables are replaced to construct the final endpoint:

| **Variable**                            | **Content**                                 | **Comment**                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| appname:                                | the name of your application                | If you have not registered a domain                               |
| [yourdomain.com](http://yourdomain.com) | The domain of your application              | If you have registered a domain                                   |
| typename                                | the name of the data type you are accessing | Use the data type name, but in lowercase and with spaces removed. |

App branches and Data API URL

The different branches of your app will have different URLs.

Developer

Developer will have the ID of the selected branch you are working on included. The ID of the Main branch is always version-test, while custom branches have their own unique IDs. The URL in *Settings - API* will show the root URL including the branch ID in the branch you are currently working.

[https://appname.bubbleapps.io/version-test/api/1.1/obj/typename](https://appname.bubbleapps.io/version-test/api/1.1/obj/typename)

or

[https://yourdomain.com/version-test/api/1.1/obj/typename](https://yourdomain.com/version-test/api/1.1/obj/typename)

Live

[https://yourdomain.com/api/1.1/obj/typename](https://yourdomain.com/api/1.1/obj/typename)

or

[https://appname.bubbleapps.io/api/1.1/obj/typename](https://appname.bubbleapps.io/api/1.1/obj/typename)

​

​

**The typename**

The typename in the URL represents the data type you want to interact with. We highly recommend that you give all your data types a unique name, especially if you are using the Data API. If two data types share the same name, the Data API will return the first one it finds.

The typename is converted to a URL friendly format by removing spaces and setting it to lowercase. For example:

**Data Type name:** Rental Unit

**Typename:** rentalunit

**Endpoint URL:** [https://appname.bubbleapps.io/api/1.1/obj/rentalunit](https://appname.bubbleapps.io/api/1.1/obj/rentalunit)

You can read more about the formatting of type names in [this article.](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-data-api/data-api-endpointthe-data-type-url)​

The body of the request should be a JSON object containing the details you want to save on the new Thing. The keys should match the names of the keys returned via a GET request for that type of thing, and the values should be [correctly formatted](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-bubble-api/the-data-api/data-api-endpointthe-typename).

**Automatically created fields and default values:**

Bubble will automatically create the following fields and their value cannot be overridden:

- Unique ID
- Created date
- Modified date

All fields that have a default value set in the data type editor will be given that default value if another value is not provided in the request.

**Creating users**

If you are creating a new user, there are two built-in special fields that are not present on other data types:

- Email (required)
- Password (optional)

This method creates a User in the database, but does not return any authentication token for that User. If you are looking to create or log in as a User in order to authenticate them as an API client, you may be interested in the article below: Article: [Authenticating as a User with the Bubble API](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/authentication/as-a-user)​

**Privacy Rules**

For this request to work, the *Create via API* privacy setting must be active on the relevant data type. The privacy rule will be checked on the new data for the thing, and the creation attempt will be rejected if Bubble does not find a matching privacy rule that allows the creation to happen.

Errors and solutions

**Possible solutions for error 401 (not authorized):**

- Check that the *Create via API* box is checked in the relevant [Privacy Rules](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-data-api/data-api-privacy-rules) in your app

400: Bad Request

Could not parse as JSON

One per row

{"status":"error","message":"Could not parse as JSON: {"Unit name": \unit1}"}

You can create a list of new things in a bulk operation by sending a POST request to the /typename/bulk endpoint. The body of the request should be formatted as a text document with one new object to create per line. The objects should be in JSON format without any newlines. The keys and values should be the same as when creating a single thing.

The keys should match the names of the keys returned via a GET request for that type of thing, and the values should be [correctly formatted](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-bubble-api/the-data-api/data-api-endpointthe-typename).

**Limitations**

The maximum number of items that can be created via a single bulk request is currently 1,000. There is also a limit of 4 minutes for the request to complete; if it takes longer than 4 minutes, items that have not yet been created will be marked as errors in the response.

The creation speed and risk of timeout depends on the available capacity that your application has as well as the size of the items that you are creating.

**Caution**: Bulk creation can consume a lot of application capacity, so we recommend that if your app is being used in production and capacity is limited, that you test bulk creation in smaller chunks and work your way up.

**Privacy Rules**

Using this endpoint requires the *Create via API* permission. The [Privacy Rule](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-data-api/data-api-privacy-rules) will be checked on the new data for each new thing, and the creation attempt will be rejected if Bubble does not find a matching privacy rule that allows the creation to happen. If some things are rejected and some are accepted, the accepted items will be created.

**Success**

The response body from this call is a text/plain document with one line per thing in the original request. Each line consists of a JSON object, with a 'status' field indicating whether or not the creation was successful. On success, the status will be 'success', and the object will contain an 'id' field with the id of the newly-created object.

Errors and solutions

**Possible solutions to error 400 (wrong content-type):**

- Make sure that the Content-type in the Header is set to text/plain.

**Possible solutions to error 400 (Could not parse as JSON):** This error is returned on each row where the JSON could not be parsed.

- Make sure that the JSON is correctly formatted

To check the formatting of JSON you can use a tool like JSON checker External link: [https://jsonchecker.com/](https://jsonchecker.com/)​

**Server error or timeout error**

Under certain circumstances, like an overall system failure or the app being completely out of capacity, you may get a generic error response that does not have individual lines for each object.

**Possible solutions to server error or timeout error:**

If you get a generic error response, try the following:

- Check Bubble’s [status page](https://status.bubble.io/) for any server downtime
- Check your application’s capacity chart to see if you may have spent all your capacity
- Check the [Bubble forum](https://forum.bubble.io/) for any threads about similar problems
- Get in touch with [Bubble support](https://bubble.io/suppor!)​

The constraints parameter should be an array of constraints that include the parameters above.

Add parameters directly in the URL as a query strings. It can be limit, cursor (Pagination), constraints (Search constraints), sort_field, and descending (Sorting options).

**Constraint examples**

You can narrow down the list returned by the Data API to match specific constraints, just like with Do a search for in Bubble. The constraints parameter should be an array of constraints that include the following:

| Key             | Value example        |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| key             | Unitname, unitnumber |
| constraint_type | equals, greater than |
| value           | Unit A, 3            |

| geographic_search                  | Use to test if the current thing is within a radius from a central address. To use this, the value sent with the constraint must have an address and a range. | See below                     |

**Example**

In this example, we will send a request to search for a unit by the name ‘Unit A’ using the following two constraints:

| **Key**         | **Value**              |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| key             | unitname, unitnumber   |
| constraint_type | contains, greater than |
| value           | Unit A, 3              |

The URL below represents the URL before URL-encoding:

GET [https://securitybook.bubbleapps.io/version-test/api/1.1/obj/rentalunit?constraints=](https://securitybook.bubbleapps.io/version-test/api/1.1/obj/rentalunit?constraints=)[ { "key": "unitname", "constraint_type": "equals", "value": "Unit A" } ,{ "key": "unitnumber", "constraint_type": "greater than", "value": "3" }]

After applying URL encoding, the same URL should look like this:

GET [https://securitybook.bubbleapps.io/version-test/api/1.1/obj/rentalunit?constraints=[ { "key": "unitname", "constraint_type": "equals", "value": "Unit A" } ,{ "key": "unitnumber", "constraint_type": "greater than", "value": "3" }]](https://securitybook.bubbleapps.io/version-test/api/1.1/obj/rentalunit?constraints=%5B%20%7B%20%22key%22:%20%22unitname%22,%20%22constraint_type%22:%20%22equals%22,%20%22value%22:%20%22Unit%20A%22%20%7D%20,%7B%20%22key%22:%20%22unitnumber%22,%20%22constraint_type%22:%20%22greater%20than%22,%20%22value%22:%20%223%22%20%7D%5D)

​

**Pagination**

In the response, Bubble will supply two values to aid in pagination:

- **Cursor**: the rank of the first item in the list
- **Count**: the number of items in the current response
- **Remaining**: the number of records left

**Sorting**

By default, GET requests are sorted by their creation date. The Bubble Data API supports the sort_field and descending parameter.

- Sort_field: the field you want to sort by
- Descending (true/false)

To define more than one sorting field, add an array additional_sort_fields, which should contain objects of the similar type as above, i.e., with sort_field and descending.

Errors and solutions

**Suggested solutions to error 404 (incompatible constraint type)**

- Check that the field type you are applying the constraint to and the constraint type are compatible
- Check that the constraint type is spelled correctly

Limitations

- There is a limit of 50,000 items in any GET request, meaning that if a database contains 100,000 items and the cursor is set at 50,001 no results will be returned
- For the Enterprise plan the limit is 10,000,000 items

 The Workflow API

The Workflow API lets you set up server-side workflows that can be scheduled in your app or triggered from an external application

This is the short-form **technical reference** entry describing the Bubble Workflow API. If you are looking for more in-depth and long-form articles on how the Workflow API works, you may be interested in checking the [Workflow API manual](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api).

The Workflow API lets you run workflows - specifically API workflows - on a POST or GET request. By using such API workflows, you can create things, sign users up, send emails, and leverage plugins to access external services.

Define the workflows as you would for a normal page, action by action. But, API workflows are one type of backend workflow, meaning they run independently of any page of your app and thus some actions (e.g. element-driven ones) are not available. API Workflows can return data, but for most incoming requests for data you will You can create API workflows after checking the box 'Enable Workflow API and backend workflows' in the API section in the Settings Tab. These workflows are defined in the Backend workflows page found in the Application Menu above the Palette.

API Workflows

These are one type of backend workflow. Not only can they be initiated from elsewhere in the app, but notably they can also be initiated via an API call, if the app's Workflow API is enabled. The general path of the Workflow API for calling API workflows follows this pattern: `https://appname.bubbleapps.io/api/1.1/wf/workflow_name` or `https://yourdomain.com/api/1.1/wf/workflow_name` `wf` is for workflow.

Note that these two terms are similar but refer to slightly different things:

- An "API workflow" is a type of workflow, specifically a type of backend workflow
- The "Workflow API" refers to the app's ability to have API endpoints that run API workflows

API workflow

This workflow is triggered on the server either when it is initiated from elsewhere in the app or via a call to the app's Workflow API. The workflow only runs after the authentication passes. As with other workflows, you can set up conditions to restrict when the workflow runs.

**API workflow name**

This is name of the API workflow and is also the URL endpoint (denoted as `workflow_name` above). Each API workflow must have a unique name with no spaces or special characters.

**Expose as a public API workflow**

Check this box to allow requests from outside the Bubble Editor via the Workflow API, either by a client that you built or another service, such as Stripe or Zapier. Non-public API workflows are useful because they can be initiated from elsewhere in the app or editor - for example, for scheduled workflows and bulk operations.

**This workflow can be run without authentication**

Check this box if this workflow can be run without authentication. Use this to enable users to sign up or login to the app.

**Ignore privacy rules when running the workflow**

An API workflow is run based on the token sent. All privacy rules will apply. Sometimes, you may want the workflow to bypass these rules, even if run without authentication, and run as an admin user who has all rights to the data. Check this box to ignore the privacy rules.

Warning: Because these are security and privacy options, use this feature with caution.

**Trigger workflow with**

Select the HTTP request (POST or GET) by which you want to trigger the request.

**Parameter definition**

Parameters are the data the API workflow can accept. You have two options to define them: manually or automatically.

To manually define the parameters, you list them one by one. This option is available when you trigger an API workflow using either a POST or GET request. When triggering with a GET request, the parameter definition is automatically set to be a manual definition. This is because GET requests only have url string query parameters and do not have a body from which to detect data.

To automatically define the parameters, you need to use an external call to hit the API workflow's endpoint, and Bubble will automatically detect the structure of the data. This option is only available when you can trigger an API workflow using a POST request. This type of detection is especially helpful for webhooks.

**Call parameters**

Define which parameters the API workflow takes. Use this when you need to send data to Bubble's server, e.g., an email for signing the user up or information to create a new thing.

For POST requests, this data should be set in the body of the POST request, except if you check the 'Querystring' box, in which case the parameter will be read from the URL as a querystring.

GET requests do not have a body, and the parameter must be read as a querystring. Therefore, querystring is automatically selected for all parameters when you trigger the workflow using GET. Enter a key and define the data type. If this is a list, check 'Is a list/array.' If this parameter is optional, check 'Optional.'

When a request is received, the Bubble workflow engine checks the validity of the data and returns a 400 error if the data is invalid. Note that if the parameter is set to 'Querystring', it will not be made available for scheduling actions, this feature should only be used if the service that hits the API requires to add the parameter in the URL. Access the value of the parameters in the subsequent actions of the workflows using the data source dropdown menu. You will see the parameters you defined at the top of the menu.

**Include headers in the detected data**

When the parameters are detected from an initialization request, you can include the request headers in the detected data if some important data is in them.

**Detect data**

Click this button to enter the initialization mode. This will open a popup, which indicates that your app is ready to receive a POST request. You can then trigger a POST request to this API workflow's endpoint, adding `/initialize` at the end of the URL. This request should include a sample of the data that should be sent when the webhook is functional. Until the request is detected, this popup should remain open. Once the request is detected, you'll be able to see the detected data and pick the data types (see below).

**Modify types**

Once an API workflow has been initialized (see above), you can modify the data structure of the received object. You can ignore some keys, and modify the field type of each key, value to be able to use the data in subsequent actions.

**Response type**

The API can return a response as a JSON object, or redirect to a page in your app and return data as querystring. Using a 302 page redirect is useful when you call the API workflow from the browser.

**Return a 200 if condition is not met**

By default, Bubble will return a 400 error if the condition you've set on the workflow is not met. Check this box to change this setting and return a 200 code instead. Use this when the API workflow is used in a webhook, and the emitting source expects a 200 code.

**Redirection on success**

Pick here the page Bubble should redirect to at the end of the workflow. If the workflow returns data, it will be added as querystrings to the URL.

**Redirection on error**

Pick here the page Bubble should redirect to at when the workflow fails. The statusCode and the message will be added to the URL as querystrings.

Timezone selection

Override the API request's timezone by setting an alternative timezone with a static or dynamic choice. For this setting to be available you must first enable the setting *Enable timezone override controls* in your app's [general settings](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/application-settings/generaenable-timezone-override-controls).

Return data from API

This action defines which data should be returned by the API Workflow.

**Content-type**

Select the content-type that you want to return:

- Structured JSON (default)
- Plain text
- Other content-type

Other content-type

Selecting *Other content-type* reveals the *Custom type* input. Enter a static or dynamic value for the content-type that you want to include in the header. This field cannot be empty.

**Text to return**

Define the text to return. It can be dynamic using the Composer.

**List of parameters**

These are the keys and data types of the parameters that are returned. When the name and type of data are set, define the data you want to return. In the case of the Workflow API, we limit the size of lists to 50 entries. For a full list of data, please use the Data API that handles pagination

 The API Connector

The API Connector allows you to set up connections to external APIs from your Bubble application.

This is the short-form **technical reference** entry describing the API Connector. If you are looking for more in-depth and long-form articles on how the API Connector plugin works, you may be interested in checking the [API Connector user manual](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-api-connector).

Introduction

The API Connector is a Bubble-developed plugin that lets you connect to almost any external API from your Bubble application. You can set up headers, parameters and a call, and each call can be set up to be used as an action in your app or asa a data source.

Response format

The API Connector expects a correctly formatted JSON body as a response.

How calls are sent

API Calls made with the API Connector are routed through Bubble's server unless specifically set not to do so (see article below).

Check this box to allow this API call to run directly from the browser, rather than Bubble's server. This option will only available in certain situations. More specifically, this option is only available for public API calls ([Authentication](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-api-connector/authentication) is set to None) with no [Headers](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-api-connector/adding-callheaders) or private [Parameters](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-api-connector/adding-callparameters). In addition, the call must be used as a [data call](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-api-connector/adding-calluse-as). *Support for Use as Action is coming soon.*

The biggest benefit of using this option, on top of performance, is that your API call will not count against API call quotas across all of Bubble, lessening the risk of accidental rate limiting by a 3rd party API.

**Note:** API Connecter calls are by default sent from the Bubble server (for non-[dedicated](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-api-connector) Bubble apps) and thus susceptible to 3rd party API rate limiting since the rate limit is shared across all Bubble apps.

Consider [sending the call from the browser, when appropriate](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-api-connector/adding-callallow-call-to-run-directly-in-the-browser), if rate limiting is a concern.

The API Connector allows you to connect to almost any external API from Bubble. It expects a correctly formatted JSON body as a response. You can supply headers, parameters, and a call body. The API calls created can be used as actions or consumed as data. When used as data, they appear in the dropdown menu for "Get data from an external API" when "Insert dynamic data" is clicked. When used as actions, they appear in the Plugins section of the Actions dropdown menu.

Once you configure an API call, you need to initialize it. If you don't, it will not appear in the Bubble Editor. Please note that initializing a call actually runs/executes it. If a call deletes an item or creates an item that requires a unique id, the Initialize call button will, if successful, delete or create the item. Thus, the next call will likely fail since the item already exists or was deleted. To initialize an API call with mandatory parameters and no sensible default, you can set a default as an example, click to “Initialize,” then unset the default.

An API call's URL is never sent to the user's browser. Call headers and parameters are only sent to the user's browser if you mark them as 'client safe.' Parameters, such as a secret API key or password, should never be marked as client safe. If you mark a parameter as client safe, you will be able to assign it dynamically in the Bubble Editor. A search term in a search query is a good example of a client-safe parameter. The call's body is sent to the user, thus it is not client safe. When you post a JSON body, you must create a header with key 'Content-Type' and value 'application/json.'

To learn more, we put together [a video tutorial on how to use the Etsy API](https://vimeo.com/162729137) and another that shows how to [create a Body Mass Index calculator](https://vimeo.com/162728948).

**Note:** API Connecter calls are by default sent from the Bubble server (for non-[dedicated](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-api-connector) Bubble apps) and thus susceptible to 3rd party API rate limiting since the rate limit is shared across all Bubble apps. Consider [sending the call from the browser, when appropriate](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-api-connector/adding-callallow-call-to-run-directly-in-the-browser), if rate limiting is a concern.

Note that even though by default, API calls are made from the server, a *description* of the call is sent to the browser and are thus visible to a savvy user. This means that any sensitive parts of the call, especially secrets / tokens, should be in fields marked "Private".

Installing the API Connector

The API Connector can be found in the plugin gallery from the Plugins tab like any other plugin. You can find it quickly by searching for the string *API Connector.*

Once installed on your app, the plugin then requires further configuration for each API and each call desired. The API Connector can handle as many APIs and calls per API as needed.

FAQ

How do I know how to authenticate and set up calls?

Most API providers have documentation available online that gives you the technical details needed to authenticate and set up the call correctly. Still, setting up API connections can in some cases be among the more technically challenging parts of Bubble development.

Our [introductory article on APIs](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/introduction-to-apis) can serve as a starting point to learn how APIs work in general. You may also be interested in checking our long-form article on [How to use the API Connector](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-api-connector) and you can check out our example case where we [set up a connection with Google Cloud](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-api-connector/case-google-translate).

Lastly, you may find it easier to set up and test a call in a service like [Postman](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api/the-data-api/data-api-requestwhat-is-postman) before setting it up in Bubble. You can export a successful call from Postman as a cURL command and import it into the API Connector.

- Most API providers have documentation for their API, including on the topic of authentication, which can be tricky
- The API provider's documentation may show you "cURL commands" as examples of the various calls (these can be identified if you see code that starts with the command `curl`). The API Connector has a feature to import cURL commands, so you can copy and paste from the documentation to get a big head start on setting up a particular call
- Default values for an API connector call (or plugin) behave differently if they are optional or mandatory. Optional default values are placeholders that aren't passed to a call unless they're changed to something else in the app. Mandatory default values are actual default values.
- Stuck? Try asking the forum for help or seeing if there is a post from somebody else about that API provider

Things to note

The API Connector currently does not support non-utf8 encodings.

All API calls return bytes of data, which must be interpreted by clients like Bubble servers or your internet browser. The oldest, and most popular encoding standard, is called ASCII, for easily translating these bytes into text characters. As a part of this standard, the most widespread encoding format for special characters is 'UTF-8'.

Because 'UTF-8' is so widely adopted, Bubble does not support any other text encodings.

**Note:** When using the API Connector or App Connector, parameters currently cannot be a 'raw' list of Bubble Things, e.g. a dynamic statement that results in a List of Things.

This is because a raw list of Bubble Things is not rendered in the kind of text formatting that API endpoints expect. One workaround for this is to use the ":join with" operator on the list of Bubble Things to turn it into a format accepted by the API endpoint (this is likely a format like ["first thing", "second thing"]).

 Authentication

The API Connector supports a range of different authentication methods.

For a more in-depth look at the different API Connector authentication methods, you may be interested in the API Connector manual article: Article: [API Connector authentication methods](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/the-api-connector/authentication)​

Authentication methods

There are many different ways to authenticate. Most API providers will have documentation available online that specifies their authentication method and many require you to generate a unique API token.

| Method                      | Description                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| None or self-handled        | No authentication required                                               |
| Private key in URL          | The private key is included as a parameter in the URL                    |
| Private key in header       | The private key is included as an HTTP header in the request             |

 Adding calls

After authentication is set up, you can add as many calls as you need to the API provider.

Call name

Choose a name for this call. It must be unique because no two API calls can have the same name.

Use as

Select from Data or Action to determine how this call will be used in Bubble. Data calls appear in the 'Get data from an external API' dropdown menu and Action calls appear in the Plugins section of the Actions dropdown menu.

Delete call

This deletes the API call.

**Warning:** Deleting an API call is permanent and cannot be undone.

Method

This is the [HTTP verb](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api/introduction-to-apis/what-is-a-restful-aphttp-method). The most common are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

URL

This is the call's URL. It is not client safe, meaning the value is not sent to the user's browser when the call is made.

Body

This is the call's body. It is client safe, meaning values are sent to the user's browser when the call is made.

Headers

Click to add and configure a new HTTP header to this specific call. Check the *Private* box to stop the information in the header to be visible client-side. Check the *Optional* box to set up this specific key to be optional.

Body type

Select here the body type of the request. Most requests will send a JSON body, but for more advanced usage (such as uploading a file), you can use a Form-data or Raw body.

**Note:** If you are using a Raw (plain text) body, be sure to include a 'Content-Type' header that specifies the format you are using so that it can be parsed properly by the API you are calling.

Parameters

Click to add and configure a new call parameter. Parameters are not sent to the client by default, but they will be if you enable the Client-safe checkbox.

Default values for an API connector call (or plugin) behave differently if they are optional or mandatory. Optional default values are placeholders that aren't passed to a call unless they're changed to something else in the app. Mandatory default values are actual default values.

Allow blank

Check this box to prevent a parameter default value used for initialization from being sent to the client or workflow inputs.

Default values for an API connector call behave differently if they are optional or mandatory. **Optional** default values are placeholders that aren't passed to a call unless they're changed to something else in the app. **Mandatory** default values are actual default values.

Include errors in response & allow workflow actions to continue

Check this box to handle API call response errors yourself. When this box is checked, Bubble will allow workflows or actions to continue when an api call error is returned and expose the error object for use in a dynamic expression. There are 4 parameters that are available as a part of the error object: error's status code (number), error's status message (text), error's body (text), and error's has returned error (yes/no).

**Note:** If you check or un-check this option after initializing the call, you will need to re-initialize as this option changes the format of the response.

Capture response headers

When the parameters are detected from an initialization request, you can include the request headers in the detected data if some important data is in them.

Allow call to run directly in the browser where applicable

Check this box to allow this API call to run directly from the browser, rather than Bubble's server.

This option will only available in certain situations. More specifically, this option is only available for public API calls ([Authentication](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-api-connector/authentication) is set to None) with no [Headers](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-api-connector/adding-callheaders) or private [Parameters](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-api-connector/adding-callparameters). In addition, the call must be used as a [data call](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-api-connector/adding-calluse-as). *Support for Use as Action is coming soon.*

The biggest benefit of using this option, on top of performance, is that your API call will not count against API call quotas across all of Bubble, lessening the risk of accidental rate limiting by a 3rd party API.

**Note:** Due to the nature of this type of client-side (from the browser) API call, it will only be sent from the browser if it doesn't require interaction with the server. For example, using the API call response as a data source.

If this option is selected, but the API call is included in a workflow that involves the server (i.e. making changes to a Data type), the API will revert to being sent from the server.

Whenever an API call is made from the browser, information related to that call can be intercepted on the client side. That means you should be cautious exposing sensitive information (e.g. API keys) in these calls. If you are unsure of the potential risk of sending data to the browser we recommend not activating this setting.

Initialize call

Every call needs to be initialized before it can be used in your app. Initialization is done for two reasons:

- To confirm that the call was successful
- Bubble uses the response to recognize the data being returned by the server

Take caution when utilizing initialization API calls as they may produce actual outcomes, including the modification of live data. Be mindful of what kind of results the initial call may produce prior to executing it.

To initialize an API call with mandatory parameters and no obvious default, you can set a default as an example, click to “Initialize,” then unset the default or select [Allow blank](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/bubble-made-plugins/api-connectoallow-blank).

 Bubble-made Plugins

This section covers all of the Bubble made plugins and their parameters. Some of the special plugins like the API Connector, App Connector, and SQL Database Connector have guides in the Help Guides section, while others have tutorials within here, where each bubble-made plugin is listed in alphabetical order.

----
 AddtoAny Share Buttons

This plugin includes a Share Buttons element for linking to your application’s social media accounts all in the same group.

**‌Share Buttons**

This element includes several social icons that when clicked, open the social network of your choice. Your user will be prompted to share a post on that social media with the page name and URL of your choice.

**Note:** This element can be blocked by some Ad blockers.

**URL to share**

The link that you want your users to post. This can be dynamic; for example, if you chose “this url,” you can share the link to the page in the application where you click this icon.

**Page name**

The name of your page as it will appear in the social media post. It’s also possible to use this as a brief caption instead. If you enter something like “Check this out,” your posts will read: “Check this out [yourappname.bubbleapps.io](http://yourappname.bubbleapps.io).”

**Add a button for**

Select which social networks you would like to include in your group of icons. Choose from Email, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Google Plus, Tumblr, Reddit, or Hacker News.

**Add a generic button for more services**

Add a plus icon to the end of your list of social icons. This will open additional options for where you can share your post, such as WordPress, Pocket, WhatsApp, Messenger, and more.

**Overwrite icon colors**

**‌**Check this box to select a custom color for your icons. This will update all of the icons to that color, so that they match your application’s brand.

Setup

Add a “Share Buttons” element to your page, from the “Visual Elements” section of the Elements tree. Enter the URL to share and page name as you would like them to appear in your post, then check any services that you would like to have an icon.

​

Then preview the page and click an icon to test what your post will look like. You might use this in a footer for your application so that on any page, your users have a way to share your application with others.

​

FAQ

**Can I add a caption to my posts?**

This plugin does not support a caption field at this time, only the page name and the URL. You can update the “Page name” field as a brief caption or create the share links manually with icons if you would like to include more custom fields.

 App plan

Bubble's pricing plans, along with a table to compare the features included in each plan, is available on the page below:

Page: [Bubble plans](https://bubble.io/pricing/compare)​

Application plan

Bubble plans are applied to a specific app, rather than to your account. As such, you can flexibly change the plan of one app to facilitate for different stages of development and growth.

Upgrading your plan offers more features and increases the app's included workload. Here, you can switch between plans and view the features each one entails. Additionally, any active coupons associated with your account will be visible here.

All payments are processed through Stripe.

Additional capacity & storage

On certain higher app plans, you can add additional units of capacity or storage (measured in 10 GB increments) as needed.

Paid plugins

This section of Settings will show any paid plugins that the current app is subscribed to.

 General

**Tip:** Deploy your application to live for changes in your Settings tab to take effect.

Privacy & Security

Application rights

Define who can see and modify the app. Choose from Private app, Everyone can view, and Everyone can edit. This can be useful when you need help from other users, through the forum for instance. This setting does not apply to the owner of the app.

Important: Making the app private will not prevent people from seeing it on the web in Live mode. To prevent unauthorized users, apply a username and password.

Limit access to this app with a username and password

Check this box to protect your page. When checked, you can define a username and password that restricts access to the page. The concept of username and password is completely different and separate from the concept of a user in the app.

Username

When the app is protected, users are prompted to enter a username and password. Define the username here.

Password

When the app is protected, users are prompted to enter a username and password. Define the password here.

Do not apply password for live

Check this box to only apply the password protection to the Development or custom version of your application but not the Live version.

Define a password policy

Check this box to require users to follow certain conditions when defining their password, increasing security.

Password minimum length

Define the minimal length for the password.

Require a number

Check this box to require users to include at least one number in their password.

Require a capital letter

Check this box to require users to include at least one capitalized letter in their password.

Require a non-alphanumeric character

Check this box to require users to include at least one special character in their password. For example, ; , " ' ? < > { } & ^ % $ @ ! * . / - + = ~ ,

Redirect users who haven't changed their password

When a user's password isn't valid, they can be redirected to a page to update it. Select the page to send them to. This page should offer update credentials functionality. If this setting is empty, users will not be redirected.

Activate two-factor authentication

Check this box if you want your users to be able to use 2-factor authentication to log in to your app. This means users will need to use an app on their phones (Google Authenticator or Authy, for instance) to generate a one-time temporary token to login. This offers higher security to your application. Note that you need to be on a Production plan to use this.

Application name to display in 2FA app

You can enter here the name of the application you want to be displayed in Google Authenticator or Authy.

Redirect users to check their temporary token

When users have activated two-factor authentication, they will need to enter a one-time token to log in. There should be a special page in your app with a Check 2FA token action to prompt users to enter their code. You have to define here which page contains this workflow.

Allow to render the app in an frame/iframe (X-Frame-Options)

It is a best practice in terms of security to prevent other websites to load your application in an iframe. We recommend keeping the DENY option, but if your app requires being loaded in iframes, you can pick 'Allow all iframes'. Note that this can have consequences on your application's security.

Make new data types private by default with a privacy rule placeholder

**Note:** Beginning in April 2021, this setting is no longer visible to new apps or to apps that did not have this setting on. Instead, Bubble introduced a new public / private choice at the point of data type creation (see [here](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/bubbles-interface/data-tamake-this-data-type-private)). Any previously existing apps that had this setting turned on will continue to have the setting in effect as before, though if they turn the setting off, they will lose the ability to turn it back on.

As you add more data types to your app, it is good to have them private by default (with privacy rules). That way, you will avoid exposing data that shouldn't be visible to every users until you have thought through the privacy rules that should apply to that type. When you check this box, a placeholder rule will be added to each new type so that data isn't visible until you've defined the rules. We recommend checking this box once your app is live in production.

Do not set cookies on new visitors by default

Bubble sets cookies in the browsers of users who visit Bubble-built apps, in order to remember who the user is, and communicate information to the user's web browser necessary for displaying the page. By default, when a user visits a Bubble app without logging in, we assign them a temporary user account. This lets you use the "Make Changes to Current User" action to store data about the user, which then gets transferred to their permanent user account if they subsequently sign up for your app. Many websites, in order to protect their users' privacy and comply with regulations, are adopting a policy of asking users for consent before setting any cookies in the user's web browser. This option is designed to assist with that. When you select "Do not set cookies on new visitors by default", Bubble will not create temporary user accounts in the database for visitors who are not logged in, and will not set cookies. Bubble will only set cookies when one of two things happen: 1) you call the "Opt-in to Cookies" action, which will create a temporary user object in the database, or 2) the user signs up or logs into your app, which requires cookies. When using this option, it is your responsibility to inform the user that your app uses cookies in order to provide the app's functionality, and to call the "Opt-in to Cookies" action or a sign up action only once the user has indicated their consent. (You may also choose to enable this option purely for performance reasons, since displaying a web page to a new visitor will generally be slightly faster and less capacity-intensive if we don't create a new temporary user). We also provide an action "Opt-out from cookies" that you can use to give the user the ability to retract their consent. Calling this action will wipe all Bubble cookies from the user's browser. Note that logging into Bubble requires cookies to function properly, so calling this on a logged in user is not recommended; instead, to support the case of a user leaving your app, delete their account. When a user who has not yet opted in to cookies interacts with your app, you may still use the "Make Changes to Current User" option to store information. However, this information will not be stored on Bubble's web servers, and if the user closes their browser window, the information will be permanently lost. On opt-in or sign up, any data stored in this way will be transferred to the new temporary or permanent user that gets created. Note that this setting only controls cookies set by Bubble as part of its core functionality. Bubble plugins may still set cookies. We are exposing the ability to check whether or not the user has opted in to cookies to plugin developers, and encourage them to make sure their plugin complies with the user's settings, but we don't have the means to enforce this. Please test your app to ensure that it is not setting any cookies that you want to avoid adding. Turning on this setting will not affect anyone who has already visited your app: temporary users created for those visitors will continue to exist, as will the cookies we use to remember them. Using this setting will prevent any iframe (using the HTML element or Video element) from using cookies, so some third-party websites (like Vimeo) embedded this way may stop working when users haven't consented to cookies, as they may mandate cookies in order to work.

General appearance

Favicon

The favicon is the icon displayed next to the title of the page in the browser's tab. Upload any image, preferably a square PNG file.

**Note:** For anti-tracking reasons, Safari does not support SVG favicons. Please consider using a png file instead.

Progress bar color

When a workflow is running, a 2-pixel-high status bar may appear at the top of the screen. Select the color of the bar here.

Repeating group spinner color

When data is being loaded in a repeating group, if it takes a few moments for the data to appear, a spinner is shown. Select the color for the spinner or make it invisible by making it transparent.

Remove Bubble mention in console

If you are on a paid Plan, you can opt to remove 'This web application is entirely built without code on Bubble ([https://bubble.io](https://bubble.io))' by checking this box.

iOS appearance

Hide Safari UI component

Check this box to hide the toolbar of Safari on an iPhone/iPad. This gives a more native experience for users, but it makes navigating the Web more difficult when in the app.

Prevent the user from zooming

Check this box to prevent users from zooming on their phones with their fingers. This gives a more native experience for users. Note that this setting does not apply to Safari.

Icon for home screen (60 x 60 pixels)

On the iPhone, users have an icon on their home screen to a specific website. Upload an icon to use in this situation. This gives a more native experience for users.

iPhone 5 startup image (640 x 1096 pixels)

When the app takes time to load, you can force Safari to display an image until the app is fully loaded. Upload an image to use in this situation.

Note: This is for the iPhone 5.

iPad startup image (portrait, 1536 x 2008 pixels)

When the app takes time to load, you can force Safari to display an image until the app is fully loaded. Upload an image to use in this situation.

Note: This is for the iPad in portrait mode.

iPad startup image (landscape, 1496 x 2048 pixels)

When the app takes time to load, you can force Safari to display an image until the app is fully loaded. Upload an image to use in this situation.

Note: This is for the iPad in landscape mode.

Custom fonts

You can add a custom font to the app. Enter the font family name as defined in the CSS file and the URL to the CSS file. It could be, for instance, 'FantasqueSansMonoRegular' and '[https://fontlibrary.org/face/fantasque-sans-mono.'](https://fontlibrary.org/face/fantasque-sans-mono.') Make sure the CSS file exists and that the font family names are correct, otherwise the font will not display. Once added, the font will be at the top of the list in the dropdown menu. Each font weight must be added separately.

Advanced options

Enable timezone override controls

Opens up a setting to control the timezone by which your app is parsing date-times for

- date-time inputs
- the page
- backend workflows

Note that this is an advanced feature.

Expose the option to add an ID attribute to HTML elements

If you need to specify some IDs on some elements on the page, you can check this box. A field will be shown at the very bottom of the Property Editor. See the [Unique ID property](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/elements/shared-propertieid-attribute-advanced) for more details and usage warnings.

 Domain / email

Domain setting

Use CloudFlare

If you set your app to use a domain before October 2019, you can check this box to toggle CloudFlare on or off.

Enabling CloudFlare requires changing DNS entries at your domain registrar, and may incur a few minutes downtime.

If you use a bare domain (of the form [mydomain.com](http://mydomain.com), as opposed to [www.mydomain.com](http://www.mydomain.com) or [app.mydomain.com](http://app.mydomain.com)) and you wish to keep your existing domain record, ensure your registrar supports ALIAS or ANAME records, or bare domain CNAME records, **before** toggling this checkbox.

Email settings

Sendgrid key

Enter your [Sendgrid](https://app.sendgrid.com/) key to send emails from your domain. If you do not add your key, emails will be sent from [your-appname]-no-reply@bubbleapps.io. Generate your key at [https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys). Make sure the key has the Send Mail permission. After you enter a key, click "Check Sendgrid key" to receive a test email.

Sendgrid Template ID

Sendgrid allows you to define templates to use when sending emails. When you build a template, add the template ID here, and it will be applied to all emails sent by the app. This is compatible with legacy and dynamic Sendgrid templates.

Bubble currently allows you to replace the body of the email with the template style only for [legacy Sendgrid templates](https://sendgrid.com/templates). Templates should contain a single "<%body%>" (without the quotes) field, which will be replaced by the content of the email defined in your actions.

Note: This is optional. Without a template, the email will be exactly what you typed in the Body field.

Admin email

When the app sends an email, it uses a generic email with your domain name, "admin@your_domain.com".

**Tip:** Because of Sendgrid's security measures, the email "admin@your_domain.com" has to be verified in your Sendgrid dashboard, otherwise the validation won't work. You can find their verification requirements [here.](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/sender-identity/)

Note: This option is only available to users with a paid Bubble plan and domain.

Sender name

Define here the name you want to display when you send an email, which will appear email clients show as "My Name" . When the sender name is defined at the action level, this sender name will be used.

Redirect all requests to the domain

When the app has a domain, it will be accessible both at [appname.bubbleapps.io](http://appname.bubbleapps.io) and [yourdomain.com](http://yourdomain.com). To redirect all [appname.bubbleapps.io](http://appname.bubbleapps.io) to [yourdomain.com](http://yourdomain.com), for SEO purposes for instance, check this box.

 Languages

General setting

Application primary language

This is the primary language for the app. All messages that the app can send or display to users, such as 'This account doesn't exist.' will be translated. Customize these messages in the Languages section in the Settings Tab. Elements that are language-sensitive, such as a calendar element, will adjust automatically.

Language field on the user type

To set a language for a given user, select the field that should contain that information. It should be a field of type text or an option set and should contain a string that matches one of the languages in the dropdown menu (as shown between the parentheses). If this is not the case or no field is set, the user's language will be the language contained in the 'lang' parameter of the URL. If this is not set, the app's primary language will be used. After changing this, users should refresh the page for the latest language texts to be included.

Attribute for language field

If the field on the user type is an option set, this dropdown can be used to select the attribute on the option set to use for the user's language. The attribute should be of type text.

Application texts & messages

Export / Import translation configuration to CSV

To make handling bulk translations easier, you can export all app text translations in one or multiple languages to a CSV or import from a CSV. We recommend exporting as CSV to get the required format of the CSV for the import.

In the exported CSV, the first column is named "plugin_name" - "CORE" refers to any app texts that come by default with every Bubble app, "USER TEXTS" refers to any app texts that you have created for this app, and other values correspond to plugins that have been installed in the app. The column "TEXT CODE" refers to the unique identifier of each app text. Any languages you've chosen to export or import will show up in separate columns, with the language code as the column header.

**Tip:** If you export your app texts then want to import them into Excel or Google Sheets, [import](https://support.goteamup.com/en/articles/2977753-faq-when-opening-csv-file-all-data-appears-in-one-column) your CSV into the program rather than opening it. Then when you export your edits as a CSV, they will be the expected format to reimport to Bubble.

Currently editing messages and texts for

This dropdown controls which language's app text translations show below. You can only edit one language's app texts at a time here; for bulk editing of multiple languages at once, use the [export / import feature](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/application-settings/languageexport-import-translation-configuration-to-csv) described above.

List of all application texts and messages

The subsequent sections of this sub-tab enumerate all the app texts: specific text segments displayed to the end-user that can be individually translated for app localization. For each app text, you'll typically see its origin.

*CORE* indicates default texts provided by Bubble, or it might display the name of a plugin. This is usually followed by a description of the text's purpose. The input field showcases the exact text that the user will see when accessing your app in that language.

**Known Issue: right-to-left (RTL)**

When displaying text in a right-to-left (RTL) format and applying certain operations or changes, the text might switch back to a left-to-right display.

If you're prioritizing RTL support, we recommend previewing your pages in run-mode to ensure they display correctly.

Facebook & Twitter

Facebook & Twitter Title

This is the title that Facebook and Twitter display when a user shares a link to the app on these social networks.

Facebook & Twitter Site name

This is how Facebook and Twitter name the site when a user shares it on these networks.

Facebook & Twitter Description

This is the description that Facebook and Twitter display below the title when a user shares a link to the app on these social networks.

Thumbnail used for links

This image is the thumbnail that Facebook displays when a user shares a link to the app. Since Facebook caches this information, you may have to trigger a refresh. Do this in the link 'Test/refresh data,' which is located below the image uploader.

SEO settings

Expose the type of tags for text elements

Check this box to customize text elements so that they have h1, h2, and h3 tags. Select the tag for each text element by editing the text's style.

**Caution:** Do not include too many h1 tags per page.

Enable canonical url

Check this box to enable a Bubble-defined canonical url tag. A canonical url tag redirects users and search engines to your primary domain in order to prioritize its ranking in search results by avoiding duplicate urls.

If you set up a custom domain for your app, this will also hide the built-in Bubble domain, in favor of the canonical custom domain.

Customize robots.txt (advanced)

By default, Bubble exposes a file that makes sure search engine crawl bots do not index the pages of the test version of the page. Check this box to customize this file, robots.txt.

**Warning:** This is for SEO experts only. Know what you are doing before editing this file because it can impact your site's indexing.

Expose a sitemap file

Check this box to select pages to add to the sitemap. When checked, the page names display, allowing you to select the specific pages to include. If the page contains dynamic content (i.e. pages that have a specific type of content), then we will also include those dynamic pages in the sitemap. We automatically filter URL's for you based on Privacy Roles. To make sure an individual URL doesn’t show up in the sitemap, make sure that a non-logged-in user (e.g. Google’s crawler) doesn’t have "Find in Searches" permissions. We currently restrict sitemaps to contain at most 50,000 URLs per page, as per the sitemap specifications. If you exceed this limit, we will include the first 50,000 URLs in our sitemap.

See [Bubble's SEO tools](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/customizing-an-application/serobots-txt-file-and-sitemap)​

Note that a savvy outsider can see the list of all pages that exist in an app, even if a page isn't listed in the sitemap and even if there's a workflow on that page that redirects away visitors upon page load. In other words, you cannot hide the fact that a page *exists*, but you can of course protect what shows up on a page if somebody visits that page.

Advanced settings

Script/meta tags in header

Some services require code to be pasted in the header of the page's HTML. Paste the code here. This is an advanced feature.

**Note:** The only valid header tags are , , and . Any invalid header code will end up in the body due to automatic repair logic in most modern browsers.

Whenever the HTML for your page is parsed by a browser like Google Chrome, it will detect any invalid HTML tag used in the headers, assume that this was a mistake, that the closing tag was missing, and add that code to the body automatically with an opening tag.

Script in the body

Some services require code to be pasted in the body of the page's HTML. Paste the code here.

**Warning:** Be careful with what you add here as improper code added here can break your app.

301 Redirections

301 Redirections point previous URLs to new ones. Use this when migrating from another platform. For the redirection to work, these URLs must point to pages that do not exist in the app.

**Caution:** This is an advanced feature.

Hosting files in the root directory

Some services require you to upload some files in the root directory of your site, usually to prove ownership. You can upload some files and define the filename that will represent them. Since filenames will be used to generate a URL, they cannot contain spaces or non-alphanumeric characters. Files will be accessible at `yourdomain.com/version-test/filename` or `yourdomain.com/filename`. Note that you should deploy to live to expose the files without `/version-test/`.

**Caution:** This is an advanced feature.

 API

Public API endpoints

Enable Workflow API and backend workflows

Check this box if you want the app to expose an API that you or other developers/services can access to run API workflows. In addition to API workflows (which can be used for scheduled workflows), there are two other types of backend workflows: recurring events and database change trigger events. Unchecking this box will disable the API endpoint. It will not stop backend workflows from running. You can pause the scheduler in the Logs tab to stop these workflows from running.

Enable Data API

Check this box if you want the app to expose an API that you or other developers/services can access to read or write the app data directly. When checked, select which types to expose as an API in the options that display.

Use field display instead of ID for key names

GET API calls or Return Data actions can either return data with the keys being a fixed ID or use the display defined for the field in the Data Types section in the Data Tab. Choose this setting here.

Hide Swagger API documentation access

Check this box if you want the app to hide the automatically generated Swagger API documentation that you or other developers/services can access. See the [Swagger Specification](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/the-bubble-api/defining-the-apswagger-specification) section for more details.

Warning

Hiding this may break some Bubble App Connector features.

3rd Party OAuth / SAML Access

If the app exposes an OAuth2 protocol, meaning users can log in to other websites using their credentials with the app, you must define the page they get redirected to once they authenticate. Select the page here.

- When your Bubble app is used as an OAuth provider, a GET call is made to: `https://[Your-App- URL]/version-test/api/1.1/oauth/authorize` with the client_id and redirect_uri as parameters.
- When this is successful, a parameter, "code", is sent back in the URL, to the external service
- Next, the external service must execute a POST call to: `https://[Your-App-URL]/version- test/api/1.1/oauth/access_token` with parameters: "client_id", "client_secret", "redirect_uri", and "code". This is known as the token endpoint.
- Lastly, the app will respond with "access_token", "expires_in", and "uid" parameters that the external site can store for the user.
   - The access_token is used in future calls to the Bubble app from the user within the external app (until expiry)
- Refreshing the token: In the POST body, set grant_type to "refresh_code" and send the refresh token as the refresh_token received previously. You will need to include the same client_id and client_secret used when getting the token in the first place.

Discourse SSO

For apps on the Professional plan and above, the Bubble app can be used as a single sign-on (SSO) provider for a Discourse forum.

For more information and set-up instructions on the Discourse side, please see [this article](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourseconnect-official-single-sign-on-for-discourse-sso/13045).

Discourse base URL

This is the URL for your Discourse forum, where you want your app's end-users to be able to log into with their app username and password.

Discourse SSO secret

This is a token generated from Discourse.

Suppress welcome message flag

If this checkbox is not checked, any user logging in via your app into your Discourse forum will receive Discourse's welcome email.

Require activation flag

Checking this setting will have Discourse send email verification emails to any user who creates an account via SSO. This is generally recommended by Discourse.

Default avatar when creating the account

If this is set, all new users created via SSO in your Discourse forum will have this image as their initial avatar.

Advanced

Download public JSON web key

Certain custom integrations with other web services will require the "public JSON web key" of your Bubble app. This is where you can download it.

 Versions

Bubble release tier

The Bubble platform is continuously advancing. On any given workday, multiple updates are rolled out, encompassing bug fixes, system enhancements, new features, and more. Every app operates on a specific "release tier," determining when it benefits from these updates to the Bubble framework.

Immediate release (default)

By default, any such Bubble code rollout will get immediately applied to all Bubble apps - we call this **"immediate release"**.

Note that occasionally, a change in the Bubble platform will be labeled a breaking change from before, a situation which creates a new "Bubble engine version". This means that we are changing the behavior of an existing Bubble feature in a way that we think is an improvement (usually this is in the context of a bug fix), but because existing apps may be relying on the old behavior, we do not want to forcibly upgrade all apps to the new code.

In these situations, apps can control when this new particular behavior is applied via Settings > Versions. This way, you can upgrade Bubble version on your development version when convenient for you and test out the impact of that change. When your app on the new Bubble version looks good to you, you can deploy to live just like any other change to your app. In other words, upgrading the Bubble version of your development version does not automatically upgrade the Bubble version of your live version - you must deploy.

If an app is on an older Bubble version (i.e. any version that's not the latest one), it will still receive any code updates that are rolled out since the breaking change, just not the breaking change itself (or any future breaking changes).

Scheduled release

Apps on the Professional plan and above can elect to receive Bubble engine updates a bit of time after they are rolled out. This setting is in Settings > Versions and is called **"scheduled release"**. On scheduled release, the app will not get Bubble engine updates immediately. Rather, apps on scheduled release will all get Bubble updates once a day (in the morning ET, though the exact time each day may vary), *only if* the Bubble codebase has not changed for a certain number of hours. This once-a-day update will contain all the platform updates since the last scheduled release. Note that some days, this release may not happen at all.

This feature can be useful for app creators that would rather not receive Bubble engine updates immediately because they want to reduce the risk of their app changing many times during a day.

Caveats and notes:

- In the event a code change is deemed very important (e.g. an urgent bug fix), the Bubble team still has the ability and right to roll out that specific code change immediately at any time, even for apps on scheduled release
- Certain infrastructure rollouts occur outside of this release system, i.e. could get rolled out at any time.
- If your app was on scheduled release and you switch it to immediate release, it will immediately get up to the most recent code release and immediately get all releases after that.
- If your app was on immediate release and you switch it to scheduled release, the platform for your app will shift to the last release that all scheduled release apps received, meaning your app may move *backwards* to a slightly older version of the codebase.
   - Please be cautious using very newly rolled out features if you intend to switch from scheduled to immediate release imminently.

Enterprise plan dedicated instances

All dedicated instances are on a different release tier called **"dedicated release".** On the Enterprise plan, you have full control over when new Bubble code is applied to a given instance. Enterprise plan users will see a special icon towards the upper right of their editor to manage the Bubble engine version their instance is running.

Generally speaking, every morning there is a new dedicated release version available to choose, containing any Bubble engine updates from the day prior.

On the Enterprise plan, dedicated instances are not obligated to update their Bubble version. However, we strongly advise regular updates to ensure the dedicated instance leverages the most recent bug fixes, new features, and other improvements.

Available Bubble Engine versions and current version

Most Bubble platform updates are seamlessly rolled out to all Bubble apps, but occasionally there are platform updates that the Bubble team considers to be "breaking changes". These usually involve a change in existing functionality that users may have been relying on previously. A breaking change is not applied to apps automatically. Instead, app editors must elect to upgrade the Bubble engine version powering their app.

When doing so, note that you first upgrade the Bubble engine version for your app's development version, which then must be deployed in order for this to apply to your live app. Thus, if you upgrade in your development version but change your mind, you have the opportunity to revert back in your development version - as long as you have not deployed to live yet, your live version will not have been impacted. However, you will not have the option to revert to a previous Bubble engine version forever, only for a very short time window after you upgrade.

Beta features

In this section, you can play with beta features that Bubble's considering releasing. To enable any beta feature, check the checkbox, and you can submit feedback to our Product team using the link in the last column.

For certain beta features, your app may be altered even after you turn off the feature. You can revert to the previous state of your app by using save points as we automatically create a save point whenever you toggle on such a feature (alternatively, you can manually adjust your app to its previous state). Note that the window for save points to which you can revert your app is limited to the window allotted by your plan. Since the save point is created after you turn on a feature, make sure to uncheck the checkbox once your app has been reverted.

**Warning:** Be aware that beta features are in ongoing development. They may have bugs or inconsistencies, and sometimes they may be discontinued or given lesser priority. We suggest first trying out these features separately before integrating them into broader areas of your app.

If you have questions about a beta feature, you can get in touch with the [Success](https://bubble.io/contact) team.

 Pricing and workload

This section covers Bubble's pricing plans and how workload usage is calculated

In this article, we will explore how Bubble's pricing works and help you understand the concept of workload.

Bubble’s vision from day one is to make software development available to everyone, regardless of their ability to code. You’re starting the businesses of tomorrow on Bubble today, and it’s our responsibility to ensure we're able to grow alongside you and give you a framework that offers the features that you need and a platform that remains stable, secure, and high-performing.

The development and launch of a new product is an important milestone for any company, and that’s why we offer a generous Free plan that lets you build and test your product. When it’s time to launch, our Starter plan is designed to be affordable so you can grow your user base and gain traction.

This is why our pricing is designed around plans based on stage and maturity of your business and what features you need as you grow. Plans also come with workload bundled in, so you don’t have to worry about purchasing additional workload until your app is scaling. Essentially, workload is a measurement of how much work Bubble does to run your app, which means we can ensure that you only pay for what you need. As your app grows in users, workflows, payments, page loads and other areas, you can scale the resources needed to match your app's evolving requirements.

In this article series, we’ll explore how the workload metric works and how our reporting tools provide insights into your app’s current and historical usage, so you can make informed decisions about development and scaling.

Plans

Bubble pricing structure is separated into different plans, ranging from the free plan to a customized enterprise plan. Each plan is designed to be relevant to different stages of your app’s life cycle and offers increasingly powerful tools to aid in collaboration, data processing, log retention and backups.

Each plan is connected to one application, meaning that you can easily work on multiple projects that are in different stages of development. You can choose to pay monthly or annually, and switch between the two at any time, as well as upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your app plan at any time.

You can see our new pricing plans in our [recent announcement](https://bubble.io/blog/2023-pricing-updates/) and you can calculate the most cost-effective way to add more workload units using our [Subscription planner](https://bubble.io/subscription-planner).

Workload units

Each plan includes a number of monthly workload units. In essence, workload is a measure of the work that Bubble does in order to power your application. Each time your app is tasked with processing an action – such as loading a page and querying your database – it contributes to your monthly workload consumption.

For example, as a user interacts with your app - opening it, navigating through it, and performing various tasks - a number of different things could take place:

- The app may need to retrieve data from a database to display on the screen
- It may need to run some workflows to complete the user's request and create
- Additional web requests might be made to third-party APIs to fetch or send data
- The server may need to process payments or authenticate user login credentials
- Images, videos, and other media may need to be uploaded

There are 12 different activity types that together make up the amount of work performed by Bubble to keep your app running. We track the total workload your app consumes over the course of one month, and then reset the count for each new month. Because every app is unique, workload is a use-case agnostic metric that enables you to scale your app based on actual consumption.

**What is workload?**

Workload is a measurement of 12 different activity types that together make up the total amount of work performed by Bubble to keep your app running. To learn more about each of these activity types and how you can track them, check out our dedicated article below. Article: [What contributes to workload?](https://manual.bubble.io/account-and-marketplace/account-and-billing/pricing-plans/what-contributes-to-workload)​

Workload tiers

Most apps can operate just fine on the workload units included in their plan, but if your app requires more workload than what is included in the Starter, Growth, or Team plan, you can purchase a workload tier to add additional units.

Workload tiers are usually not necessary until your app is launched to the public. For instance, a workload tier may become necessary when you begin to grow your user base, work on larger volumes of data running and/or frequently communicating with external APIs.

This way:

- Workload tiers are offered with volume discount, meaning you can lock in a number of units at low cost.
- There’s no need to upgrade your plan – for example, you could stay on the Starter plan if you don’t need any of the advanced features on the Growth or Team plans, and at the same time, you could add a workload tier to scale your app.

![Pricing – Blog Image - Workload Tiers@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fcvo481wziiq82EBqnEIB%2FPricing%20%E2%80%93%20Blog%20Image%20-%20Workload%20Tiers%402x.png?alt=media&token=c00f6601-ebc0-416f-a38a-9798f2a0e73f)

Overages

In addition to pre-purchasing workload, we allow apps to accrue flexible overages so that your app stays available if it exceeds its monthly workload allotment. Flexible overages are charged at a unit price applied to each additional 1000 workload units needed to cover the extra work required.

This way:

- You only pay for the actual consumption
- Your app can handle overages with no delays or outages
- There’s no need to upgrade your plan for spikes in workload. You can make an informed decision about upgrading when the time is right.

Flexible overages can be enabled and disabled at any time. To disable flexible overages, go to Settings - App plan and uncheck *Enable overages.*

Overage notifications

You will receive an email notification when your app has reached 75% of its available workload units, to give you ample time to evaluate your options, including upgrading your plan, buying a workload tier, or enabling or disabling flexible overages.

You will also receive an email notification when your app has reached 100% and overages will kick in.

Add-ons

Regardless of its plan, you can also add add-ons that add functionality or extra resources to your app.

Plugins

Plugins extend the functionality of your app by providing features and elements that go beyond Bubble’s core capabilities. Plugins can add new elements, actions, data sources and API connections and are made both by Bubble and by independent developers. Here's a breakdown of how plugins are priced:

- **Free:** Many plugins are offered for free
- **Monthly subscription:** some plugins require a monthly subscription
- **One-time payment:** some plugins require a one-time payment

Numerous paid plugins offer the option to pay a monthly subscription or a one-time payment. Note that certain plugins may rely on external API services that may incur additional costs beyond Bubble's pricing structure.

You can check out Bubble's plugin store in the link below:

​[Plugin store](https://www.bubble.io/plugins)​

File storage

All plans include an amount of file storage space. However, if your app requires more than what is included in the plan, you can purchase additional storage.

Storage costs are $3 per month for 100 GB.

Bandwidth

Each plan also comes with bandwidth, measured by the total monthly bandwidth used to serve your application over the internet.

| **Plan** | **Bandwidth** |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Free     | 1 GB          |
| Starter  | 100 GB        |
| Growth   | 500 GB        |
| Team     | 1 TB          |
| Agency   | 1 GB          |

Measuring workload

To help you understand and analyze workload, we provide analytics tools that give you insights into the various processes and activities that contribute.

Bubble's workload charts provide reports that offer a view of your app's total monthly workload, as well as the ability to drill into individual processes, down to specific searches, workflows, API requests and expressions.

While Bubble has you covered with flexible overages when heavy processing is needed, the best user experience and most cost-efficient operation will always come from building with performance in mind. We encourage you to use our workload reporting tools actively while designing and maintaining your app to identify areas for improvement.

**How to use the App Metrics dashboard:** To learn more about how to use the App Metrics to drill down into your app’s workload activities, check out the article below: Article: [Using App Metrics](https://manual.bubble.io/account-and-marketplace/account-and-billing/pricing-plans/using-app-metrics)​

 What contributes to workload?

This section covers how different activity types contribute to your app's total workload

Workload, in essence, measures the work that Bubble performs to power your application. As your app processes actions such as loading a page or querying your database, it contributes to your monthly workload consumption.

We track a total of 12 different activity types that each contribute to the total workload of the current month. We track the total work that occurs during each month, and reset the count at the beginning of each new month. Since every app is unique, this approach ensures a use-case agnostic way that lets you scale your app based on actual consumption.

Each of the activity types below contribute to your app’s total monthly workload. You can gain deeper insight into some of these metrics by exploring your app's workload charts and identify the areas of your app that are doing the most work and take steps to optimize their performance.

What does an activity cost in WU?

The below table represents the cost of the raw ingredients for an action. In other words, the ultimate cost of an action can be different than the table indicates, depending on what that activity does. For example, performing a database search has the base cost reflected in the table, but that cost can vary depending on the complexity of the search and the amount of data to search through and return.

As a result, if the actual workload consumption doesn't match your expectations, we recommend using your [app metrics](https://manual.bubble.io/account-and-marketplace/account-and-billing/pricing-plans/using-app-metrics) to isolate the activities that consume the most workload and look at ways to make it more efficient.

![pricing-wu-table.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FIJpjJ9b5m0lsVbmsmZ4X%2Fpricing-wu-table.png?alt=media&token=1c711f91-0c18-422d-bd31-48b0351cca94)

Checking specific workload units consumed in the logs

Using the *Server logs* tab, you can check the workload charged for each action, as well as the total for each workflow.

Drilling down using the App metrics dashboard

In many cases, workload consumption can be isolated to a select few of your app’s processes that are either workload-intensive or triggered frequently. To help you identify what pages and activities in your app are consuming the most workload, you can use the App Metrics dashboard to get an overview.

![CleanShot 2023-07-20 at 07.45.54.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F6GS6XfMSLCh7jVzjV0T1%2FCleanShot%202023-07-20%20at%2007.45.54.png?alt=media&token=ae6d82f4-ef09-4c9f-a619-fdc11edf2cf7)

The App metrics dashboard gives an overview and a detailed view of your app's workload and what contributes to it.

There, you can see the total aggregated workload usage for the last 30 days, broken down by Development and Live consumption. Both Development and Live contribute to your total usage.

To learn more about how to use app metrics to drill down into your app’s workload activities, check out the article below or try our interactive walk-through:

In the same dashboard, you can also see a pie chart visualization of which activities contributed the most to workflow usage in the selected period. You can use the bar chart to select the time period to include in the pie chart visualization. By clicking on a sector in the pie chart, you can drill down to see where in your app this is occurring, down to individual pages, workflows, elements and expressions.

 Using App Metrics

This section covers how to use App metrics to analyze how different activities contribute to your app's total workload over a given period of time

You can think of workload as the sum of all the work performed by a variety of activity types.

The App Metrics dashboard gives you several visualizations of the work that your app is doing. The charts serve two purposes:

- To give you an overview of your app’s total workload
- To give you an easy way to drill down into each activity and get a granular view of how single workflows and expressions contribute

Workload usage

The bar graph helps you get a transparent view of how much app your work is doing in total, and at what times. This visualization lets you see trends and patterns in your app's workload usage over time, which can help you plan and make more informed decisions about future upgrades or changes to your app.

![CleanShot 2023-07-20 at 07.45.54.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F6GS6XfMSLCh7jVzjV0T1%2FCleanShot%202023-07-20%20at%2007.45.54.png?alt=media&token=ae6d82f4-ef09-4c9f-a619-fdc11edf2cf7)

The total workload usage chart breaks your total workload into days and hours.

Each column in the bar graph represents one day, going back 30 days from the current date by default. This example above is from a complex app that processes thousands of users, searches and workflows.

Changing the time frame

To drill down into an individual day, simply click that day in the chart. Let’s look at July 14th when the workload was a bit higher:

![workload-by-day.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F0l0zEVPWbpCTtHQQJFvQ%2Fworkload-by-day.png?alt=media&token=e0359a81-9e0b-49c6-b78c-e04f0903644a)

Clicking on a day zooms the chart in on that day and presents the hourly consumption.

Here we can see that something happened between 3:00 pm (15:00) and 6 pm (18:00) that added more to the workload of that day than the rest: this lets you zoom in more closely in time and get an understanding of what exactly happened between 3:00 pm (15:00) and 6 pm (18:00) that gave Bubble more work to do.

The App metrics will reflect the time zone of the device that is accessing them.

Isolating the timeframe extends down to the granular pie chart below, which lets you identify activity types on the top level and drill down into individual workflows and expressions to see what they are doing.

Granular view

The granular view gives you a pie chart where each slice represents one of the activity types that we track. This way, you get an understanding of the types of processes that contribute the most.

Let’s look at an example:

![workload-by-activity.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FvdUOxePrd6QZkIiFkhwJ%2Fworkload-by-activity.png?alt=media&token=acfb3ec3-81de-4638-a34e-dd772748ef0e)

The granular pie chart presents a list of the activities that contribute the most in total. Clicking in the chart zooms in on that activity type.

In the chart above we can see clearly that two activities make up the majority of the work that this app performs:

- Fetching data
- Scheduled Workflows

This data alone can already tell us something about how the app is built: fetching data (which relates to searches and other ways that information is being fetched from the database) makes up a large bulk of the workload consumed. A large part is also made up of scheduled workflows; this activity type covers workflows that are scheduled using the *Schedule API Workflow* action. We can see the percentage by hovering over the sector in the pie chart.

Drilling down

Clicking on each of these activity types provides an even more detailed view of individual instances of that activity type, and how much each one contributes to its total. Let’s click on the *Fetching data* sector to dig deeper:

![workload-by-activity-drilldown.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fl1cIx6UwyWGY365pemRL%2Fworkload-by-activity-drilldown.png?alt=media&token=7e31d6f2-5b0f-4999-97ea-ae2c76eb53e0)

Hovering one of the sectors in the pie chart shows you the percentage that particular data fetching activity contributed in the selected time frame.

Now we are down to a list of different data fetching operations.

By again hovering the mouse over one of the vectors in the chart, we can see the percentage consumed by that specific activity. Clicking that takes us directly to the *Do a search for* that's consuming the workload. In this case, it was an element searching for a data type called *Clients*.

![do-a-search-for-workload.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FxEOLfsZoRJgli9STAnky%2Fdo-a-search-for-workload.png?alt=media&token=62e6ef9f-64bb-444d-98a2-e4f808390b21)

Clicking in a vector in the pie chart takes us directly to the search in the workflow tab.

This way of continually drilling down in the chart can teach us a lot about where the work happens and where we can potentially make adjustments to make the app more efficient.

This not only helps you keep your app operating at a cost-effective level, but it can also speed up processes to improve the overall experience for users.

Excluding details

As you research your app’s workload, it can sometimes be useful to see what the chart looks like if we exclude some information. For example, if you want to stop focusing on workflows, you can hide that information in the chart by clicking on that activity type in the right-hand list.

Let’s hide the Workflow activity type to focus on the others:

![exclude-activity-types.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FZKQ9oTHbtKkxduIwhSRr%2Fexclude-activity-types.png?alt=media&token=2b20b143-e8ed-4896-90fc-b0217b4202ec)

As you can see, when we click on the Workflows entry in the list, it becomes crossed out, and the chart is updated to exclude it: the dark blue slice is no longer visible.

Real-time metrics

The real-time workload reporting allows you to view and access workload data in real time. The bar chart provides one-minute granularity for the last 24 hours. This is useful for checking recent or highly time-specific workloads to learn more about how they contribute in isolation.

Checking specific workload units consumed in the logs

Using the *Server logs* tab, you can check the workload charged for each action, as well as the total for each workflow.

Using the data

Creating efficient applications is a process of continuous improvement. Using the App Metrics dashboard is an effective method for recognizing the processes that have the greatest impact on your app’s workload. As you analyze your workload data, you will discover that some activities are essential for your app to operate, while others can be optimized.

The flexibility of Bubble’s platform opens up to different ways of solving the same problem, and sometimes small changes can lead to great improvements in efficiency.

 Plans and billing

This section covers how to manage your plan, workloads, payments and invoices

**Note:** [https://bubble.io/pricing](https://bubble.io/pricing) is the authoritative source about pricing information, in the event of discrepancies with the documentation.

Managing your plan

You can subscribe to a paid plan and manage the plan that you are on in the *Settings - App plan.*

![Pricing – Blog Image - Plans.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FKWjsj6S8A6owIW1IiQzK%2FPricing%20%E2%80%93%20Blog%20Image%20-%20Plans.png?alt=media&token=2ddf8462-2c8c-4f4c-880d-ddf774a79ad8)

Bubble's pricing structure comprises various plans, from the free tier to customized enterprise solutions. Each plan caters to different stages of your app's life cycle, providing progressively advanced tools for collaboration, data processing, log retention, and backups.

Each plan is connected to a single application, allowing you to work on multiple projects at different development stages. You have the option to pay monthly or annually, and you can switch between the two whenever you like.

Modifying a plan

You can change your plan at any time during the period. When switching between paid plans, the features of the new plan become instantly available, and the cost is prorated. A credit for the unused days from the previous plan will be automatically applied to your Bubble account, and you'll be charged for the corresponding days on the new plan.

Both of these calculations – remaining time and unused time – will appear on your next Bubble invoice.

Canceling a plan

To cancel a plan, simply downgrade it to the Free tier. Be mindful of the features associated with each plan to ensure you understand the adjustments that come with the change. In particular, if you have set up a custom domain, downgrading to the Free tier will result in losing the connection with that domain.

Transferring a plan

When multiple users have admin privileges on an app, any of them can assume responsibility for the app's plan payments. If a transfer takes place, the new paying user's card will be charged immediately.

The person you are transferring the app to must be a registered Bubble user prior to the transfer taking place.

To transfer an app:

- Go to *Settings - Collaboration*
- Under *Invite a user,* type in the email of the user you want to transfer to
- Click the *Transfer* button

![transfer-app.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FNGaANcecTyZTEY0O1wR8%2Ftransfer-app.png?alt=media&token=f047a271-ca0d-494d-ab60-ce9d610cc49a)

Additional workload

You can read more about the difference between Workload tiers and overages in our main pricing article. You can also use our Subscription planner calculator to estimate the best option for you.

Article: [Pricing plans](https://manual.bubble.io/account-and-marketplace/account-and-billing/pricing-plans)​

Page: [Subscription planner](https://bubble.io/subscription-planner)​

Workload tiers

If your app needs more workload than the current plan provides, you can purchase a workload tier for additional units.

![workload-tiers.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F3cLEIUdvJHRQ3XEmiOy0%2Fworkload-tiers.png?alt=media&token=40494bb7-a3a5-4443-8645-64a9c844add3)

Overages

In addition to pre-purchasing workload, we offer flexible overages, ensuring your app remains accessible even if it surpasses its monthly workload allotment. Flexible overages are charged at a unit price for each additional workload unit.

Flexible overages can be enabled or disabled at any time. To disable them, navigate to *Settings - App plan* and uncheck *Enable overages*.

Payment

Payment methods

Bubble accepts major credit and debit cards (see Stripe's [information](https://support.stripe.com/questions/which-cards-and-payment-types-can-i-accept-with-stripe) for more details)

- Visa
- MasterCard
- American Express
- JCB
- Discover
- Diners Club

Invoices

You can find your invoices in the Account Page, where you also have the option to define your business name and address. If you update your business name or address, you can download an updated version of your invoices reflecting these changes.

You can also opt to have invoices emailed to your registered email address. Check *Email every invoice* to enable this.

![billing.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FuveLZ3TEL1dKWisMAWcb%2Fbilling.png?alt=media&token=48d2cdc2-d118-4eb0-8d2e-b0e258b6e649)

Declined payments

Bubble relies on an external service, Stripe, to process credit card transactions. A declined charge can result from the interaction between Stripe and your bank's fraud system. Even with correct information and a history of successful payments, a transaction may be declined. When processing a payment, we send all the information you've entered, and the system evaluates the risk level based on this data.

If your payments are being declined, double-check that all entered information is accurate. If you still encounter issues, consider contacting your banking institution to inquire about any restrictions on your card.

Refund policy

We do not offer refunds. Any paid month is non-refundable and cannot be credited back to your account.

Discounts

We extend a 30% discount for students, educators, and non-profits, applicable with appropriate documentation.

To get this activated on your account, please visit our [Support center](https://bubble.io/support) to get in touch with a member of our Support team.

Discounts cannot be applied retroactively, cannot be applied to Enterprise plans, cannot be applied to workload tiers 3-5, and cannot be combined with other discounts such as Referral or Affiliate credits

 Billing cycle

​

Understanding the WU billing cycle

We measure workload usage based on the calendar month. This means that your app's workload usage will accrue from the 1st to the last day of each month. As a new month begins, we reset this count, providing a fresh start for tracking your app's activity.

Billing cadence

The billing of workload is synchronized with your app plan or subscription billing cycle. This synchronization ensures consistency and predictability in your billing:

- Monthly Billing Cycle: If your app plan is on a monthly billing cycle, any overages incurred by your app are included in your next monthly bill. For instance, if your app plan is billed on the 10th of every month, here's how it would work:
- Accrual Period: Workload Units (WU) accrue from December 1st to 31st.
- Calculation of Overages: At the end of the calendar day on December 31st, we calculate and invoice any overages for December.
- Billing: On January 10th, you're billed for your monthly app plan (covering January 10th to February 10th). This bill also includes the overage amount for December.
- Annual Billing Cycle: For those on an annual billing cycle, billing for the previous month’s overages occurs at the start of each month. This approach ensures that you are always up-to-date with your app's usage and expenses.

Prorated charges for purchased workload tiers

When you purchase an additional workload tier, we prorate the initial charge. This proration aligns with the billing period of your app plan, whether it's monthly or annually. This method ensures that you only pay for what you use, and the charges are aligned with your existing billing cycle, making it easier to manage and predict your app's running costs.

 FAQ: Pricing and Workload

This section covers frequently asked questions about workload and our pricing plans

Workload Basics

What is workload?

Workload is a measure of the work that Bubble does in order to power your application. Whenever your app is asked to perform a task like processing a payment, communicating with an API, or searching through your database, this counts towards your monthly workload usage. More technically, workload measures all the underlying activities your app does as it runs. Activities include database operations, workflows, and web requests. For a full list of inputs, see our article on [what contributes to workload](https://manual.bubble.io/account-and-marketplace/account-and-billing/pricing-plans/what-contributes-to-workload).

How much workload will I need?

The amount of workload an app needs depends on a variety of factors. If you’re new to Bubble, the best way to assess your workload needs is to get started on a Free plan. From within your free app, you will be able to see how the activities unique to your app contribute to workload usage. The Free plan comes with more than enough workload to build any kind of app you can imagine! Most apps on a paid plan do not need more workload than the amount included in the Starter, Growth, and Team plans. If your app scales to the point where you outgrow the amount of workload on your plan, then you can subscribe to a workload tier on a monthly or annual basis. To learn more, see our [workload explainer blog post](https://bubble.io/blog/what-is-workload).

What are my options if I need more workload?

If you need more workload than the amount that comes with the Starter, Growth, or Team plan, you have two options: you can purchase a workload tier for additional workload, or you can pay for overages as you go. Apps on the Free plan or Agency plan cannot subscribe to [workload tiers](https://manual.bubble.io/account-and-marketplace/account-and-billing/pricing-planworkload-tiers) and cannot enable overages. You can use our [Subscription planner](https://bubble.io/subscription-planner) to calculate the most cost-effective way to add more workload units.

What are workload overages?

In a given month, your app on the Starter, Growth, or Team plan will incur overages if workload usage exceeds the amount of workload that comes bundled into your app plan plus the amount of workload that you may have purchased via a workload tier. Overages are pay-as-you-go. If you do not have a workload tier subscription, then the overage rate is $0.30 per 1,000 workload units. If you have a workload tier subscription, you can find your app’s overage rate [here](https://manual.bubble.io/account-and-marketplace/account-and-billing/pricing-planoverages). Apps on the Free or Agency plan cannot incur overages because these plans are designed for development. For details on overage billing, please see our [billing section](https://manual.bubble.io/account-and-marketplace/account-and-billing/pricing-plans/pricing-fabilling).

Can I cap the amount of workload my app uses?

Yes, you can disable overages in the App Plan tab so that your application does not use more than the amount that comes with your app plan plus any additional workload you may have purchased via a workload tier. If your app hits the workload limit while overages are disabled, you will receive an email notification that your app has been taken offline. You can bring your app back online if you enable overages or purchase a workload tier. If you keep overages disabled, then your app will go live again at the start of your next billing period.

Workload Details

What is the relationship between workload and speed?

Workload is a measure of the work that Bubble does to power your application over the month. There is no direct relationship between workload and speed. However, apps that were previously throttled by capacity will experience significant improvements in speed after switching to the new pricing plans.

What is the relationship between user count and workload?

The more users who use your app the more activities your app is performing, which means your app will consume more workload. The size of your user base is a factor, but it is not necessarily the main driver of workload usage. For example, your application could have a small number of users but run a lot of activities in the background throughout the month. Whenever Bubble is doing work to power your application, workload usage goes up. The load of each activity is just as important as the quantity of activities.

What is the relationship between workflow runs and workload?

The more workflows your app runs, the more workload your app will consume. The amount of workload it takes to run a workflow can vary significantly depending on how many steps are in the workflow and what actions the workflow is performing. Thus, the number of workflow runs is a factor, but it is not necessarily the main driver of workload usage. For example, your application could have a small number of workflow runs that each consume a lot of workload. Or your application could have a large number of workflow runs that each consume very little workload. The load of each workflow is just as important as the quantity of workflows run. To learn more, see our [blog post on workload](https://bubble.io/blog/what-is-workload).

What is the difference between Live vs. Development workload?

All paid apps have 100,000 monthly workload units for their Development environment included in their plan.

Live workload comes from your end users interacting with the Live version of your application. Development workload comes from app editors interacting with your Development environment. Common sources of Development workload include activities like testing your app and cleaning your database. Live and Development workload both contribute to your total workload usage.

Does using the editor consume workload?

The only activity in the editor that uses workload is running bulk operations and importing/exporting data in the Data tab. Otherwise, interacting with the editor does not contribute to workload usage.

What are ways I can optimize and reduce my app’s workload usage?

You can view workload charts in the Logs tab of the editor to see your app’s workload usage over time and to drill into the activities that are contributing to workload usage. To learn more, see our article on [how to use the workload charts](https://manual.bubble.io/account-and-marketplace/account-and-billing/pricing-plans/using-app-metrics).

Billing

Do I need a plan for each project?

You can have as many projects as you’d like, and each project has its own plan.

When do I get billed? When is my billing period?

You will get billed on a monthly or annual basis for your app plan. Your billing period starts on the day you sign up for your subscription. If you purchase a workload tier, your initial charge will be prorated based on the same billing period as your app plan. If workload overages are enabled on your app, you will get billed for any additional workload units your app consumes above the limit in the previous calendar month.

How does overage billing work?

If your app plan is on a monthly billing cycle, then any overages that your app incurs in the previous calendar month will get included in your monthly bill. If your app plan is on an annual billing cycle, then you will get billed at the start of each month for the previous calendar month’s overages.

Will I get notified before I’m charged for overages?

Yes, you will receive an email notification when your app has reached 75% of its available workload units. You will also receive an email notification when your app has reached 100% and overages will kick in.

Can I upgrade, downgrade, or cancel my app plan at any time?

Yes, you can make changes to your subscription in the App Plan tab.

Can I switch between monthly and annual billing at any time?

You can switch from monthly to annual billing at any time.

Can I subscribe to an annual subscription for my app plan and a monthly subscription for my app’s workload tier?

No, your app plan and workload tier must be on the same billing cadence.

What are add-ons that I can purchase separate from what comes in the plans?

Workload tiers (only available to apps on the Starter, Growth, or Team plans), additional file storage for $3 per 100 GB, and plugin subscriptions.

Capacity

What happened to server capacity? Will it still be different across the new plans?

All apps across all the new pricing plans will operate at the highest capacity that Bubble can offer while maintaining the integrity of our own infrastructure. Apps that were previously throttled by capacity will experience significant improvements in speed after switching to the new plans.

How does server capacity translate to workload?

There is no direct conversion from server capacity to workload. Capacity is like a speed limit on the highway, whereas workload is the distance traveled. On legacy pricing plans based on capacity, apps get throttled when they exceed the capacity limit. On the new pricing plans, we avoid throttling apps and instead measure monthly workload, the aggregate amount of work Bubble does to power your app in a given month. There are no limitations to the amount of workload your app can consume unless you choose to disable overages.

 Plans & Billing (legacy)

The information in this article is related to the old pricing structure. As of May 1st, 2023, this content is considered legacy information and may contain details that are no longer up to date.

Please see the article below for details regarding the new structure.

Article: [Plans and billing](https://manual.bubble.io/account-and-marketplace/account-and-billing/pricing-plans/plans-and-billing)​

**Note:** [https://bubble.io/pricing](https://bubble.io/pricing) is the authoritative source about pricing information, in the event of discrepancies with the Docs.

​

You can subscribe to a paid plan for your application in the Settings tab. Subscribing to a paid plan will offer more features and more capacity in terms of server capacity. You can see the details of the different plans in the [Pricing Page](https://bubble.io/pricing). One user can have multiple apps with different plans.

When you pick a plan in the editor, you can see a mention of the impact of the plan change on your application's feature.

![unnamed.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2F-M5smrJkMfjcu6xQRWw4%2F-M5smv6gK17h2CTjvanV%2Funnamed.png?generation=1587943314708888&alt=media)

Monthly vs Yearly plans

You can either pick monthly or yearly plans. Yearly plans offer a discount over the monthly cost. A plan is billed in advance on a monthly basis or a yearly basis. Note that once you have chosen a frequency, you cannot move to another frequency without first canceling your plan. If you add some capacity to your app, for instance, you'll be billed for the remaining time on the period you've subscribed the plan (current month or current year).

Add-ons

Bubble lets you run advanced programming operations on our servers. Capacity determines the amount of server and database CPU time that your app can consume in a given interval. On the Professional plan and above, we reserve server capacity for your app to ensure that your app runs quickly. Each Professional plan app starts with 3 units of reserved capacity and each Production plan app starts with 10 units. You can scale your app to match your app growth by buying additional units for $30/unit/month.

If your app temporarily exceeds its capacity, we rate-limit the speed at which it runs to keep it under the threshold. You can monitor your usage in real time from the Application Editor.

Modifying a plan

You can modify your plan anytime during the period. If you are switching from one paid plan to another, the features of the new plan will be immediately accessible, and the amount will be prorated. A credit will automatically be applied to your Bubble account for the number of days you haven't used on the previous plan, and you will be charged for the corresponding days on the new plan. You will see both of these calculations (remaining time and unused time) on your next Bubble invoice.

Canceling a plan

You can cancel your plan at anytime. Note that when you do so, the cancellation will be immediate, and you'll lose access to paid features. In particular, you will lose the connection with the custom domain you have set up (if any).

Transferring a plan

If more than one user is an admin on an app, they can take the ownership of the payment of the app's plan. When a transfer occurs, payment will start at the end of the current billing period on the new paying user's card.

Invoices

![Screen_Shot_2020-06-16_at_3.42.57_PM.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FFxHYv56krAQ53ZPaCS2d%2FScreen_Shot_2020-06-16_at_3.42.57_PM.png?alt=media&token=cb3a3871-b31b-4f7c-868a-f89610262f10)

You can find your invoices in the [Account Page](https://bubble.io/account). You can define your business name and address in this page. If you modify your business name or address, you will be able to get an updated version of your invoices.

Discounts

We offer a 30% discount for a year for students, educators, and non-profits (renewable with proper proof). To get this activated on your account, please visit our [Support center](https://bubble.io/support) to get in touch with a member of our Support team.

Discounts cannot be applied retroactively, cannot be applied to Dedicated Plans, and cannot be combined with other discounts such as Referral or Affiliate credits.

Declined payments

Bubble uses an external service to process credit cards (Stripe). A declined charge will be the result of the interaction between Stripe and your bank's fraud system. Even if you entered your information correctly and made previous, successful payments, a payment may still be declined. When we process a payment on your card, we send all the information you have entered and the system will take them into account to define the risk level.

If your payments are being declined, please make sure all the entered information is correct and if you are still unable to make a payment, try reaching out to your banking institution and ask if there are any restrictions on your card.

Payment methods

Bubble accepts major credit and debit cards (see Stripe's [information](https://support.stripe.com/questions/which-cards-and-payment-types-can-i-accept-with-stripe) for more details)

- Visa
- MasterCard
- American Express
- JCB
- Discover
- Diners Club

Annual payment

We can accommodate yearly payments if you need this for invoicing and accounting reasons. Bubble does not offer discounts for yearly payments.

Refund policy

We do not offer refunds. Any month paid cannot be reimbursed nor credited to your account.

----
 Account Management

Modifying your credentials

You can modify your email and password in the [Account Page](https://bubble.io/account). For security reasons, you'll need to enter your existing password to modify either your email or change your password.

If you used Google Authentication and if you want to modify the email you're using to login, you should set up a password first. When signing up with Google, no password is created, but if you reset the password (in the Log in popup), you'll be able to define a password. This password will be the one you will need to enter when updating your credentials.

If you need to unauthorize your Google account, you need to do this in the Google App Dashboard. Revoking access to Google is not something that is done on the Bubble side.

Deleting an account

You can delete your account in the Account page. Note that when you delete your account, we delete your personal data (email, Bubble usage, etc.), but we do not delete the apps you have created and their database. If you need to delete them as well you should delete the apps first.

----
 Building Apps for Others

Agency Subscription

We encourage Bubble users to build apps for others. We have set up the Agency Subscription to let you build apps and transfer ownership to your clients smoothly. This subscription provides you with a specific plan for the apps you are building for your clients.

Once an app is on the Agency plan, generally all features will be accessible and the branding will be removed in the Development Version of the app.

*Apps on this plan are all password protected in Run-mode.

You can subscribe to the Agency Subscription in the account page. Once an agency is created, you will be able to add agency members to your subscription and they can start working on apps.

*This plan enables all features that help you build functionality of your Bubble app. It does not necessarily grant access to features which are only needed once an app is in production (e.g. bulk data operations), because that would likely be the purview of your client.

Full details for this plan can be found [here](https://bubble.io/agency); that is the definitive source.

Getting listed as an agency

There are pages on the Bubble website, notably [bubble.io/agencies](https://bubble.io/agencies), that show agencies that wish to be publicly listed. If you are the admin for an agency, you can submit your agency to be shown via your Account > Billing page. Upon submission, a member of the Bubble team will reach out to verify certain details before you will be shown in the list.

(This does not constitute an official endorsement by Bubble or partnership with Bubble - this is just to verify that you exist as an agency and to filter out the more egregious forms of abuse of agency status.)

 Selling on the Marketplace

*(Note:* [*https://bubble.io/marketplace-policies*](https://bubble.io/marketplace-policies)* is the authoritative source about marketplace policies, in the event of discrepancies with the Manual.)*

You can sell templates and plugins on Bubble. While you can make such items for free, if you start selling them, you will need to register as a seller to accept payments. Payments will be made directly to you, and Bubble will take a fee on the different transactions.

**Note:** Payments to marketplace creators (sellers) are made via Stripe, so you must have a Stripe account in order to be paid.

Defining your seller identity

​[Your Plugins page](https://bubble.io/my_plugins) is where you can define you seller profile. You can set up a logo, business name, and register with Stripe in order to accept payments. Note that you will need to handle compliance aspects with Stripe directly. This can include providing identification and tax information.

**Note:** If your country is not supported by Stripe yet, you will not be able to sell on the Bubble Marketplace. This includes restrictions from Stripe such as [not allowing](https://support.stripe.com/questions/stripe-india-support-for-marketplaces) for transfers from non-India accounts to India-based accounts.

Building, distributing and selling templates

If you are a designer, building templates on Bubble is a great way to share good design, empower other users to start their app with a slick design, and make money.

When you create and distribute a template on Bubble, there are a few rules you should keep in mind. Note that these rules are as of March 22, 2017, and Bubble reserves the right to update them at any time.

Template distribution

At this stage, we do not validate templates before they appear on the platform, but we reserve the right to withdraw a template if it doesn't comply with the following rules, or if it's being reported as a poor quality template.

You can advertise your templates on any site (including online ads) but you should point to the template page on Bubble. All transactions have to happen via the Bubble Platform.

Intellectual Property

Templates' intellectual property is the propriety of the template owner. When adding a template to the library, as any other application, you have to comply with the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://bubble.io/acceptable-use-policy) you agreed to when you signed up for Bubble. In particular, you should own the design, logo and images' rights that you are using in your template.

A template sold on Bubble should not be sold on another platform, including the design, logo, etc. Note that once a template is published, it can be subsequently removed from the marketplace, but the underlying app cannot be deleted (otherwise anybody who has already purchased the template would not be able to use it in the future).

Commission Structure

When you sell a template, the total payout for the owner is 75% of the facing value. You must register with Stripe to be able to take payments on the platform.

Note that this fee structure may change (but will not be applied retroactively on already published templates if a change occurs).

Support and debugging

As an owner of a template, you commit to fix issues that users that use the template may report. If a template is being reported as having issues and if no action is taken, Bubble reserves the right to withdraw the template from the marketplace.

Users can (and are encouraged to) leave some reviews, feedbacks and questions. You are responsible for handling questions and support requests. Failure to follow up with users that reach out (and report you to the Bubble Team) may lead to the cancellation of your Seller Profile.

 Application and data ownership

**Disclaimer:** This page is provided for informational purposes only. In the event of any discrepancies between the content here and the official terms of use or other legal documents found on our [legal terms page](https://bubble.io/terms), the official terms of use and legal documents prevail.

Intellectual property ownership

Simply put, you have ownership over your data, encompassing both your app's design and any data uploaded by your users (based on the agreement you have with them). On the other hand, Bubble retains ownership of the underlying code that powers your app. Think of it like how Microsoft owns the software Microsoft Word, but doesn't claim ownership over the documents you create with it.

Exporting your application & data

We support automatically exporting user-created data in the form of CSV files. Additionally, with the Bubble API, you can craft scripts for a more automated, scalable way to access your data.

Bubble apps can only be run on the Bubble platform; there's no way of exporting your application as code. If you decide to move off the Bubble platform, you'll have to rebuild the application logic, although we can help you export the design. We'll do our best to help you leave if you want to. Our goal, though, is for Bubble to grow with your app.

As Bubble is built on Javascript and can be extended with code and API integrations, you'll essentially never hit a hard limit of the system. Our Enterprise plan lets you have a dedicated cluster only for your apps, maintained by us, and you can scale as your business grows independently from other Bubble applications.

Your trust in Bubble is paramount. While we're committed to a lasting presence, we guarantee that, in the unlikely event of discontinuation, Bubble's source code will be made available under an open-source license. This ensures you can maintain your app on a self-hosted Bubble server.

 Dynamic expressions (beta)

This section covers how to set up dynamic expressions in Bubble

The expression composer is currently being updated and is available as a pre-release beta. This article covers the beta release; to read about the current stable release, please see the article below:

Article: [Dynamic expressions](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/dynamic-expressions)​

In this article we'll be diving into the world of dynamic expressions.

Dynamic expressions are like "live" formulas that update in real-time based on user input, database updates and other changes in your app.

![dynamic-expression-example.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F1Tj46WBbQ1rjUSVNhSJh%2Fdynamic-expression-example.png?alt=media&token=c33cc365-eff6-4e27-938d-55810988b068)

Dynamic expression let you work with data dynamically and in many different ways. In the example above we are searching for users in the database and counting them. The result would be a live reflection of the count of users that updates automatically every time a user is added or removed.

Dynamic expressions are one of Bubble's basic building blocks and are used in a wide range of scenarios.

For example, let's say you're building an app that tracks customer orders. You might use a dynamic expression to calculate the total cost of an order, based on the price of each item and the quantity ordered. Or you might use a dynamic expression to automatically update inventory levels when a new order is placed.

Like formulas in a spreadsheet, dynamic expressions in Bubble update in real-time based on changes in your app and database. So if a customer changes the quantity of an item in their order, the total cost of the order will automatically update. Likewise, if the price of an item changes in the database, it will automatically update in your app.

By mastering dynamic expressions, you'll be able to create powerful, interactive apps that are constantly kept in sync with relevant data.

How dynamic expressions are structured

Although dynamic expressions can vary greatly in complexity, they essentially consist of three main components: **data sources**, **operators** and **comparisons.** Each individual use of any of these components is called an **atom**.

Atoms

​[**Data source**](https://manual.bubble.io/pre-release/dynamic-expressions-betdata-sources)​

A data source is any place from which Bubble can retrieve data, such as the database, the current user or an API.

​

​[**Operators**](https://manual.bubble.io/pre-release/dynamic-expressions-betoperators)​

Operators functions or actions that can be performed on the data source, such as counting, sorting and calculating.

​

​[**Comparisons**](https://manual.bubble.io/pre-release/dynamic-expressions-betcomparisons)​

Comparisons let you compare two compatible values, such as two numbers, data types or strings of text and get a yes/no result

​

Data sources

A *data source* is any place from which Bubble can retrieve data, such as:

- A database search​
- The current user​
- An Option set​
- An API call​
- The current date/time
- The user's current geographic position​

This is not an exhaustive list, but it illustrates the point that data sources are not just database records, but *any* channel from you can draw some sort of information. Expressions always start with a data source, and you and then (often optionally) add one or more operators to that data source to transform, aggregate or manipulate the data in some way.

Operators

Here we describe what operators are in general. If you want the list and technical documentation on each operator, you may be interested in checking out the core reference entry on operators. Reference: [Operators](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/data/operations-and-comparisons)​

Operators are all kinds of functions or actions that can be performed on the data source, such as filtering, sorting, grouping, aggregating, reducing, joining, and many others, depending on the data type you are working on.

![user-count-expression@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FWjU9vKrCvYlcW3FNCNs5%2Fuser-count-expression%402x.png?alt=media&token=1ffa145c-8ae3-415a-854c-51f26090d7dd)

As we saw in the example from earlier, the dynamic expression goes through two steps, separated by a colon (:):

- **Data source**: we are using the *Do a search for* data source to search for users
- **Operator:** we added the *count* operator to the search to instruct Bubble to count the results

An expression will always return the value of its last step. As such, the expression above would not return a list of users, but a number representing the count of users (such as 50).

Data-specific operators

Bubble will adjust the list of available operators based on what kind of data the data source returns. In the example above, the data source *searches for users and returns a list.* Since this is a quantifiable resource, we can instruct Bubble to count the number of entries in the list.

![user-count-dropdown@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FfvRryznO3LLThlWSkq8L%2Fuser-count-dropdown%402x.png?alt=media&token=5bbb1a07-982f-4011-a2dc-ac87d60d3d4b)

Bubble will list the operators that are relevant for the type of data returned by the data source. In this example the data source is *Search for users* (which returns a list of database records) and we can select different operators that apply to that data type.

Were we to change the data source to another type of data, such as a *date*, the list of available operators changes to reflect it:

![date-time-expression-options@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FdByct1NaT9zcFY8Ir70n%2Fdate-time-expression-options%402x.png?alt=media&token=01e5ac82-0487-40fc-892c-d0844cbb4b4e)

In this example we've changed the data source to one returning a datetime, and Bubble changes the list of available operators to reflect it.

An operator will in many cases change the format of the data returned. Let's look at the two examples in the above screenshots:

- In the first we are using an operator to count the results of a search, and the data switches from a list of database records to a number
- In the second, we are looking at a datetime, and the returned data depends on the operator:
   - The *formatted as 3/10-23* operator will turn the datetime into a text string such as "3/10-2023".
   - The < -range - > will turn two datetimes into a date range​
   - The +seconds/+ minutes etc operators will add the number of seconds and minutes but keep the datetime format

Comparisons

Comparisons are the third component of an expression and are used to compare two values to reach a value that is either yes or no. You can see comparisons as a sort of question. In the two examples below, we first see how a human would read the question, and then how it would be formatted in an expression.

Is 5 a bigger number than 3? Answer: yes

This is how a human being would ask the question, and it's not open-ended: the answer will always be yes. In an expression, the same question would be laid out more mathematically and always have a clear answer:

5 > 3 = yes

The > symbol represents *bigger than*, and again the answer would be yes.

In these two examples, *5* and *3* are both *data sources*, and the > is the *comparison*. As such, we are comparing the value of two data sources to get to a yes or no (or true/false if you will).

Expressions are set up to work with dynamic data sources and operators, so let's compare two numbers in an expression that are the results of counting things. In our earlier example, we counted the number of users. Let's assume we have another data type called *Task* and compare how many there are of each.

The structure in this expression will be:

Data source:operator | comparison | data source:operator

Search for users:count | is | search for tasks:count

We are replacing the > with an *is*. In other words, we are not asking *is one bigger*, but changing the question to *are they the same*. This is what that looks like in an expression:

![dynamic-expression-boolean.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FdAeJPEXZkEyVzvYnqqoy%2Fdynamic-expression-boolean.png?alt=media&token=579408fe-aa9f-48e4-ada6-002ef1bddb72)

Let's assume we have 50 users and 20 tasks, in which case the question we ask is:

Is 50 the same as 20? Answer: No

Comparing other types of data

Comparisons can handle any type of data as long as they can be compared. For example, we could ask the question:

Is London the same as New York? Answer: No

In this example we're no longer looking at numbers, but comparing two strings of text. Since the two strings are not identical, we can conclude with the answer *no*. In a Bubble expression we might get those names from a data type called *City,* looking something like this:

![compare-city-names-expression@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FrTxxIDmA6t4fXtBqiDPT%2Fcompare-city-names-expression%402x.png?alt=media&token=c9076850-7b39-43e4-9b7e-88a8a0489587)

In the expression above, we are combining multiple data sources, operators and a comparison to ask the question:

Is the name of the City saved on the current user the same as the name of the first city returned by this search? Answer: no

In this example we compared the *names* of the city (text) specifically, but we could also ask Bubble directly whether the two cities are indeed the same database record:

![user-city-expression@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F2Hf8npXUy3gTiSLtVR4c%2Fuser-city-expression%402x.png?alt=media&token=8780ae76-cd65-4d98-8799-8d15179c7b4a)

The question has now changed to:

Is the database record saved in the City field of the user the same as the database record found with this search? Answer: No

The two examples would yield the same result: no, they are not the same. However, if the two cities shared names (such as *Paris* in the US state of Texas and *Paris* the capitol of France), the first one would respond with yes and the second would respond with no: they have the same name, but they are not the same database record.

As we can see from that example, you should put some thought into comparisons to make sure that they can reliably give the right response.

Working with Dynamic expressions

Creating

Dynamic expressions can in many cases be mixed in with regular text to produce a coherent message to your users. In the example above for example, we set up a dynamic expression to count the number of users, and wrapped the expression in a text:

There are [expression] users in your app

To your users, the full text will simply be: "There are 50 users in your app", hiding the calculation going on under the hood.

To add an expression anywhere in a text field, set focus to that field and then click the “*Add dynamic data”* button or use the “/” keyboard shortcut.

![add-dynamic-expression.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F2AphncnrwODZALz8zB41%2Fadd-dynamic-expression.png?alt=media&token=2f3d1624-3a40-41a6-b5e8-d25371028ac7)

Clicking the *Add dynamic data* button creates a dynamic expression. In the example above we have a text that says *Number of users:* and want to add an expression that returns the actual number.

Sometimes there will be a field with an empty expression.

- To create an expression there, simply click on it
- To delete it, click on it and then click backspace

Deleting

To delete a dynamic expression, click into the expression and then press backspace.

Editing

Each component of a dynamic expressions is called an *atom.* Each atom can be edited to change the final outcome of the expression. You can do this in two ways:

- Click the part of the expression that you want to change. For example, if the expression reads *Search for users:count*, then both *Search for users* and *count* can be clicked for editing.
- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate left and right in the expression. This works in the same way as when you edit text.

Both of these methods also allow you to *insert* an atom at the end of or, or in-between two existing atoms. For example, to apply some further filtering before we count our users, we could insert the *filter* operator in between the search (*Search for users)* and the aggregation (*count)*. Since expressions are read left-to-right, that filtering would then apply before the count, changing the result of the expression.

The easiest way to accomplish this is to use the arrow keys to select where to insert the atom, and then click / to get the list of commands.

![insert-atom-expression@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fex8XGMNCdYL5rLfy3dTG%2Finsert-atom-expression%402x.png?alt=media&token=270fd268-0c61-469c-a734-fba3383c9ad8)

In this example we inserted the operator *filtered* to apply some additional filtering to the list of users before counting it. The overall structure of the expression is maintained.

To delete an atom in an expression, click on it or use the arrow keys to select it, and then click backspace.

Copy/pasting

There are two ways in which you can copy and paste expressions:

Copy one expression

The first way is to copy a single expression. To do that, right-click the expression and pick *Copy expression.*

![copy-expression.gif](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F7ZU55SfZWPNCriqD4mxk%2Fcopy-expression.gif?alt=media&token=d2976b56-ee57-41da-9f44-8845471064c7)

Note that to paste expressions, you need to right-click an area that accepts an expression. This can be an existing expression, or you can click *Add dynamic data* and then paste it:

![CleanShot 2023-08-15 at 17.01.10.gif](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FtMmgz8ktoWvRmspIjiYn%2FCleanShot%202023-08-15%20at%2017.01.10.gif?alt=media&token=2dc66026-3606-44a4-a7ff-5e4affd72e66)

Copy all content in a field

If you want to copy not just one expression, but all content of a field, you can right-click outside of the expression but still inside the input field. Note that this will copy both the expression and regular text:

![paste-input-field.gif](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FgFAECF7zKWQ1Nkv4VW7Q%2Fpaste-input-field.gif?alt=media&token=5fb64ee3-5872-4167-8407-2b5d6fdbd047)

To paste it, you need to click inside of a field that accepts it, but not on an expression.

Expression use cases

Expressions, being such a central part of the Bubble platform, are used in a wide range of different scenarios. Let's look at a few:

In elements

Dynamic expressions can be used in elements to provide a value. We have already looked at how we can place it in a text element to display the result of the expression as a text.

Example 1: Set an initial date

In the example below we are using an expression to set the initial value of a date/time picker element:

![dateime-expression.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F6Wr7w8uSWO8adnG3ulJC%2Fdateime-expression.png?alt=media&token=a16c7d93-94f4-472f-8753-9a12c90946e6)

The *initial content* field tells Bubble to show a date in the element when the page loads. In a humanly readable sentence, we are telling Bubble:

Set the initial content of this Date/time picker element to the current date and time, and then add one day

The result for the user would be that the default value of the element is at the current time tomorrow.

Example 2: Load a list of users and show them in a repeating group

When using a repeating group, we need to provide a data source, and this too is done by setting up an expression. For this, we could simply define a data source such as *Do a search for Users*, but to show how we can use expressions to be more complex, let's include an operator as well:

![CleanShot 2023-08-07 at 17.08.48.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F3qmsaAFhWO3QUWgyh29Z%2FCleanShot%202023-08-07%20at%2017.08.48.png?alt=media&token=e87fe74e-71b6-4c88-8ff8-7a513e26e51f)

In this example we are using the *intersect with* operator to generate a list of users thats different than what we would get in the data source alone. In a humanly readable sentence, we are telling Bubble:

Search for one set of users and a second set of users and then return the list of users who are in both lists

If we assume that the two searches produce different results by having different constraints, we would be left with the list of users that are present in both of the search results.

In conditions (conditional expressions)

In this section we briefly explore how conditions work. If you are interested in learning more you can check out our dedicated article on the subject: Article: [Conditions](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/conditions)​

Conditions, or conditional expressions, are expressions that are set up to return a value that's either yes or no and then use that answer to either *do* something or *not* do it:

This can be used to:

- Style an element depending on whether the condition is true
- Trigger a workflow to run whenever the condition is true
- Ask whether a workflow/action triggered somewhere else should run

Example 1: hide an element if the user isn't logged in

For our first example, we'll place a condition on an element that will hide the element if the user is logged out. For example, if we have a *Sign out* button, it makes sense to hide it.

![conditional-expression-user-logged-out@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FxVB7M1eeOzX2K0HNEinw%2Fconditional-expression-user-logged-out%402x.png?alt=media&token=60f5ef8b-6b36-4b82-b90c-67d4f317e726)

- The first part is the expression: we use the data source *current user* and the operator *is logged out* to get a yes/no anwer
- We instruct Bubble to change one of the element's properties: we set *this element is visible* to *unchecked.*

In a humanly readable sentence, we are saying:

If the current user is logged out, make this button invisible

Example 2: stop a workflow from running

In the second example, we'll look at how a conditional expression can determine whether a workflow should run or not when it's triggered. Let's say we have a form where users can create a new Task, but we don't want to create the contact if the user hasn't provided a name for the task:

![only-when-expression@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FIASZDLDiq3JVf4hiONfU%2Fonly-when-expression%402x.png?alt=media&token=f58bcb91-dc9e-4211-ae5d-1fb43e1540f0)

In this example, the data source is the input element *Input task* and we've added two operators:

- *value* instructs Bubble to return the value from that input (which would be the task name the user has provided)
- *is not empty* gives us a yes/no answer to whether the *value* operator returns an empty result or not

In a humanly readable sentence, we are saying:

Only run this workflow if the user has provided a name for the new task

In workflows

In this section we briefly explore how workflows work. If you are interested in learning more you can check out our dedicated article on the subject: Article: [Workflows](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/logic/workflows)​

We can also use expressions in workflows to produce a particular result.

Example 1: saving aggregated data

Let's say that we run an app where users provide reviews for different products. In addition to the built-in user data type, we have a custom data type called *Review* which includes a number field where users give a score between 1-10.

As the user keeps adding reviews, we want to save their *average* score on their profile. Let's see how expressions can do that.

- We have workflow that makes changes to the current user, and we've set it to make a change in a field called *Average score*
- We then add the data source *Search for users* and we add a constraint that the Review must have been created by the data source *This user*.
- We add the operator *each item's Score* which changes the result from a list of Reviews to a list of numbers (the score from each review)
- Lastly, we add the *average* operator, which takes a list of numbers and calculates the mean value. The data type in the end is a *number* which is what the *Average score* field on the user expects

In a humanly readable sentence, we are saying:

Save the average score to the user by searching for all the users review and calculating the mean

Example 3: creating a date range from two date values

A date range is a piece of data that provides a range between to datetimes by storing a start and end. They simplify the process of determining if a datetime falls within a specific range, among other uses.

Let's say we have system where users can pick a start and end date for a vacation, and we want to turn that into a date range and store it in a custom state.

We'll use the value of the two date pickers as the data sources, and combine them using the < - range - > operator.

![set-state-expression-example@2x.png](https://1878144943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FFmroL4xqo67aPpUAPLW2%2Fset-state-expression-example%402x.png?alt=media&token=dc01b4a2-8a3b-4586-841e-b3b980ec914d)

- The first field is the *element* where we store the custom state – in this case we chose the page itself (index)
- Then we choose the custom state. We created one and named it *Date range*.
- Then we generate the date range by using the < - range - > operator.

How expressions are processed

Dynamic expressions are evaluated from left to right, which means that the system reads each part of the expression in order, one at a time, starting from the leftmost component and moving towards the right. This is different from the mathematical convention used in many other programming languages, which evaluates expressions based on the order of operations, such as parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

This left-to-right evaluation order can sometimes lead to unexpected results if you are used to other programming languages, so it's important to keep in mind when writing expressions in Bubble. However, it can also make expressions easier to read and understand, since they are evaluated in a more intuitive way that matches the way we typically think about expressions in everyday language.

In order to maintain this left-to-right evaluation logic, Bubble constantly inserts parentheses into your expression. When you hover over your expression, you’ll notice that there are underlines that will change color depending on what part of the expression you hover. These underlines correspond with the “level” of your expression, equivalent to the level of parentheses.

Every atom that has the same color underline when you hover is part of the hovered atom’s level. Atoms that remain white but do not get colored underline treatment are sub-expressions within the colored expression. Atoms that are greyed out are part of the larger expression surrounding your colored expression.
